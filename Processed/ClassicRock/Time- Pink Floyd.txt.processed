Ticking away moments make dull day 
fritter waste hours offhand way 
Kicking piece ground home town 
Waiting way 
 
Tired lying sunshine staying home watch rain 
young life long time kill today 
day years got 
told run missed starting gun 
 
run run catch sun sinking 
Racing come 
sun relative way youre older 
Shorter breath day closer death 
 
year getting shorter time 
Plans come naught half page scribbled lines 
Hanging quiet desperation English way 
time gone song 
Thought Id say
