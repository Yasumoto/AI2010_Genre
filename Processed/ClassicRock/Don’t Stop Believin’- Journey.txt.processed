Just small town girl living alonly world 
took midnight train going 
Just city boy born raised South Detroit 
took midnight train going 
 
singer smoky room smell wine cheap parfume 
smile share night 
goes 
 
Strangers waiting boulevard 
shadows searchin night 
Streetlight people living emotion 
Hiding night 
 
Working hard everybody wants thrill 
Payin roll dice Just time 
win lose born sing blues 
Oh movie ends goes 
 
Dont stop believing 
Hold feeling 
Streetlight people
