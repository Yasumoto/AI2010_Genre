far galaxy I hear calling 
odyssey 
realms time space 
enchanted place 
I come face face 
long ago someday 
Countless times weve met met way 
luminescent night 
beams neon light 
I wingged flight 
cross starry sea powered 
victory 
Theres child sundress 
Looking rainy sky 
Theres place desert 
ocean danced 
Theres song silence 
Weaving time 
notes music 
Searching remembered rhyme 
mountain high 
heroes dare 
Stand stallion mare 
shall destiny 
anothers odyssey 
Weve met way 
Weve met way
