throne God 
I strong perfect plea 
great High Priest Love 
lives pleads 
graven hands 
written heart 
I know heaven stands 
tongue bid depart 
 
Satan tempts despair 
tells guilt 
Upward I look 
end sin 
sinless Savior died 
sinful soul counted free 
God just satisfied 
look pardon 
 
Behold risen Lamb 
perfect spotless righteousness 
great unchangeable I 
King Glory Grace 
I die 
soul purchased blood 
life hid Christ high 
Christ Savior God
