long I remember 
Ive walking wilderness 
Praying Father waiting time 
Ive come mission 
soon Ill life world 
 
Im praying garden Im looking miracle 
I journey hard reason I born 
cup passed 
Lord I pray world 
 
I carry cross Ill carry shame 
end road 
struggle pain Ill love 
wont vain 
Yes Ill carry cross 
Ill carry shame 
 
I feel like Im Im treated like criminal 
time come Ive wrong 
Father forgive know theyve world 
 
days Ill coming 
days Ill coming
