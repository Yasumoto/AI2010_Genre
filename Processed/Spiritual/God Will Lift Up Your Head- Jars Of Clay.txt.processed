wind fear 
Hope undismayed 
God hears sighs counts tears 
God lift 
God lift 
Lift head 
 
God lift head 
God lift head 
God lift head 
lift lift head 
 
Leave sovereign way 
choose command 
shall wandering way 
Know wise strong 
wise strong 
 
God lift head 
God lift head 
God lift head 
lift lift head 
 
waves clouds storms 
gently clears way 
Wait time shall night 
Soon end joy 
Soon end joy 
Soon end joy 
Soon end joy 
 
God lift head 
God lift head 
God lift head 
lift lift head
