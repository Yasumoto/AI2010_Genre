I feel discouraged 
shadows come 
heart fell lonely 
long heaven home 
 
Jesus portion 
constant friend 
eye sparrow 
I know watches 
eye sparrow 
I know watches 
 
 
I sing Im happy 
I sing Im free 
eye sparrow 
 
I know watches 
watches 
eye sparrow 
I know watches 
I know watches 
I know watches 
 
I sing Im happy 
I sing Im free 
eye sparrow 
 
I know watches 
watches 
eye sparrow 
I know watches 
watches 
watches I thought 
watches
