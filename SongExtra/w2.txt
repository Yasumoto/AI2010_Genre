If were to be the light
That shines for all of man
Then how can we light the way
If we dont go to them
I believe to know Gods heart
Is to meet them where they are

Wont you shine on
Wont you shine on
You can shine on
Shine on

In all thats said and done
And everything you do
Just let your life glorify
The one who shines on you
I believe we worship Christ
When we show the world His light

Wont you shine on
Wont you shine on
You can shine on
Shine on

Shine on
Shine on

Wont you shine on
Wont you shine on
You can shine on
Shine on

Wont you shine on
Wont you shine on
You can shine on
Shine on
