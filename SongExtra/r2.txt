Well Im running down the road
Tryin to loosen my load
Ive got seven women on
My mind
Four that wanna own me
Two that wanna stone me
One says shes a friend of mine
Take it easy take it easy
Dont let the sound of your own wheels
Drive you crazy
Lighten up while you still can
Dont even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand
And take it easy
Well Im a standing on a corner
In winslow arizona
And such a fine sight to see
Its a girl my lord in a flatbed
Ford slowin down to take a look at me
Come on baby dont say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is
Gonna save me
We may lose and we may win though
We will never be here again
So open up Im climbin in
So take it easy
Well Im running down the road trying to loosen
My load got a world of trouble on my mind
Lookin for a lover who wont blow my
Cover shes so hard to find
Take it easy take it easy
Dont let the sound of your own
Wheels make you crazy
Come on baby dont say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is
Gonna save me oh oh oh
Oh we got it easy
We oughta take it easy
