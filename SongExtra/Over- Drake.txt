I know way too many people here right now that I didnt know last year
Who the fuck are yall
I swear it feels like the last few nights weve been everywhere and back
But I just cant remember it all
What am I doing what am I doing
Oh yeah thats right Im doing me Im doing me
Im living life right now man
And this what Im do til its over
Til its over but its far from over

Alright bottles on me
Long as Im a drink it
Never drop the ball fuck yall thinking
Making sure the young money ship is never sinking
Bout to set it off in this bitch Jada Pinkett
I shouldnt have drove tell me how Im getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I can teach you how to speak my language Rosetta stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing Ive ever known
Bout to go thriller Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need is a fucking red jackets with some zippers
Super good smito a package of the swishas
I did it over night it couldnt happen any quicker
Yall know them well fuck it me either
But point the biggest skeptic out Ill make them a believer
It wouldnt be the first time Ive done it throwing hundreds
When I should be throwing ones bitch I run it ahh

Uhhh
One thing bout music when it hits you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that makes these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me I know better than that its just game
Its just what comes from fame
And Im ready for that Im just saying but
I really cant complain everything is kosher
Two thumbs up even Anne Roper
I really cant see the end getting any closer
But Ill probably still be the man when everything is over
So Im riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me can you see me get your visine on
Yall just do not fit the picture
Turn your widescreen on
If you thinking Im a quit before I die dream on
Man they treat me like a legend
Am I really this cold
Im really too young to be feeling this old
Its about time you admit it who you kidding man
Nobodys ever done it like I did it
Ahh
