If you gotta start somewhere why not here
If you gotta start sometime why not now
If we gotta start somewhere I say here
If we gotta start sometime I say now
Through the fog there is hope in the distance
From cathedrals to third world missions
Love will fall to the earth like a crashing wave

Tonights the night
For the sinners and the saints
Two worlds collide in a beautiful display
Its all love tonight
When we step across the line
We can sail across the sea
To a city with one king
A city on our knees
A city on our knees
Ohohohohoh

If you gotta start somewhere why not here

A city on our knees
Ohohoh

Tonight couldnt last forever
We are one choice from together
Tonight couldnt last forever
Ooh
Tonight couldnt last forever
We are one choice from together
As family
Were family
Oh Tonight couldnt last forever
We are one choice from together
You and me
Ya you and me
Tonights the night
For the sinners and the saints
Two worlds collide
In a glorious display
Cuz its all love tonight
When we step across the line
We can sail across the sea
To a city with one king
A city on our knees
A city on our knees
Oh oh oh
A city on our knees
A city on our knees
Oh oh oh
If we gotta start somewhere why not here
If we gotta start sometime why not now
