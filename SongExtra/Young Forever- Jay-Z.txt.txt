Lets dance in style
Lets dance for a while
Heaven can wait were only watching the sky
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not
Let us die young or let us live forever
We dont have the power but we never say never
Sitting in the sandpit
Life is a short trip
The musics for the sad man

Forever young I wanna be
Forevery young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever and ever
Forever young I wanna be
Forevery young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever forever

So we livin life like a video
Where the sun is always out and you never get old
and the champaign is always cold
and the music is always good
and the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
and they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
without a wrinkle in today
cuz there is no tomorrow
just a picture perfect day
that last a whole lifetime
and it never ends
Because all we have to do is hit rewind
so lets just stay in the moment smoke some weed drink some wine
reminisce talk some shit forever young is in your mind
leave a mark they cant erase Neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut
Ill be fine
Im forever young

Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever and ever
Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever forever

Fear not where fear not why fear not much while were alive
Life is for living not living uptight
Until youre somewhere up in the sky
Fear not die Ill be alive for a million years bye bye are not for legends Im forever young my name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks over kitchen stoves over Pyrex pots My name shall be passed down to generations while debatin up in barber shops
Young slung hung here Showed that a nigga from here With a little ambition just what we can become here
And as the father pass the story down to his sons ear Young get younger every yearyeah
So if you love me baby this is how you let me know Dont ever let me go thats how you let me know baby

Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever and ever
Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever forever

Slammin Bentley doors hoppin outta Porsche
Poppin Up on Forbes list
Gorgeous hold up Niggas thought I lost it
They be talking bullshit I be talking more shit They nauseous hold up Ill be here forever You know Im on my four shit I aint with foreclosure I will never forfeit Less than four bars Guru bring the chorus in Did you get the picture yet Im painting you a portrait of Young

Forever young I wanna be
Forevery young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever
Forever young
