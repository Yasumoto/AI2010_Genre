Inflatable pool full of dads hot air
I was three years old
Splashin everywhere
And so began my love affair
With water

On a river bank
With all my friends
A big old rope tied to a limb
And your a big old wuss
If you dont jump in
The water

Yeah when that summer sun starts to beatin down
And you dont know what to do
Grab your swimming trunks
Ice up that old igloo
Drive until the map turns blue

Daytona Beach on spring break
Eighteen girls up on stage
White tshirts about to be sprayed
With water

Oh leter go boys

Yeah when that summer sun starts to beatin down
And you dont know what to do
Just go and grab someone you wanna see in a bathing suit
And drive until the map turns blue

You can stay right there
When the daylights gone
Play truth or dare
And it wont take long
Fore you and her got nothin on
But water

All you really need this time of year
Is a pair of shades
And ice cold beer
And a place to sit somewhere near
Water
