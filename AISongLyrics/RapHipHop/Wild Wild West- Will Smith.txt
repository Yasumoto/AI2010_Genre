Jim West desperado rough rider
No you dont want nada
None of this six gun in this brotha runnin this
Buffalo soldier look its like I told ya
Any damsel thats in distress
Be out of that dress when she meet Jim West
Rough neck so go check the law and abide
Watch your step with flex and get a hold in your side
Swallow your pride dont let your lip react
You dont wanna see my hand where my hip be at
With all of this from the start of this
Runnin the game James West tamin the west so remember the name
Now who ya gonna call

Not the GBs

Now who you gonna call

G double E G

If you have a riff with people wanna bust
Break out before you get bumrushed at the Wild Wild West
When I roll into the Wild Wild West
When I stroll into the Wild Wild West
When I bounce into the Wild Wild West Sisqo Sisqo

We going straight to the Wild Wild West
We going straight to the Wild Wild West

Now now now now once upon a time in the west
Mad man lost his damn mind in the west
Loveless givin up a dime nothin less
Now I must put his behind to the test can you feel me
Then through the shadows in the saddle ready for battle
Bring all your boys in here come the poison
Behind my back all the riffin ya did
Front and center now when you look back kid
Who dat is A mean brotha bad for your health
Lookin damn good though if I could say it myself
Told me Loveless is a mad man but I dont fear that
Got mad weapons too aint tryin to hear that
Tryin to bring down me this champion
When yall clowns gon see that it cant be done
Understand me son Im the slickest they is
Im the quickest as they is did I say Im the slickest they is
So if you barking up the wrong tree we comin dont be startin nothin
Me and my partner gonna test your chest Loveless
Cant stand the heat then get out the Wild Wild West

We going straight to when I roll into thethe Wild Wild

To any outlaw tryin to draw thinkin youre bad
Any draw on West best with a pen and a pad
Dont even think about it six gun weighin a ton
10 paces and turn just for fun son
Up till sundown rolling around
See where the bad guys are to be found and make em lay down
The defenders of the west
Crushin on pretenders in the west
Dont mess with us cuz were in the Wild Wild West
