Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now wish right now wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now wish right now wish right now
Yeah
I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
Cause after all the partyin and smashin and crashin
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when youre staring at that phone in your lap
And you hoping but them people never call you back
But thats just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel
And they sayin what would you wish for
If you had one chance
So airplane airplane sorry Im late
Im on my way so dont close that gate
If I dont make that then Ill switch my flight
And Ill be right back at it by the end of the night
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now wish right now wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now wish right now wish right now
Somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah back when I was tryin to get into the subway
And back when I was rappin for the hell of it
But now a days we rappin to stay relevant
Im guessin that if we can make some wishes outta airplanes
Then maybe yo maybe Ill go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when aint nobody listened to my mix tape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for the Cada whats up Bobby Ray
So can I get a wish to end the politics
And get back to the music that started this shit
So here I stand and then again I say
Im hopin we can make some wishes outta airplanes
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now wish right now wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now wish right now wish right now
