Its like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
Its like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
Broken glass everywhere
People pissing on the stairs you know they just dont care
I cant take the smell I cant take the noise no more
Got no money to move out I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with the baseball bat
I tried to get away but I couldnt get far
Cause a man with a towtruck repossessed my car
Dont push me cause Im close to the edge
Im trying not to lose my head ah huhhuhhuh
ah huhhuhhuh
say what
Its like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
Its like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
Standing on the front stoop hangin out the window
Watching all the cars go by roaring as the breezes blow
Crazy lady livin in a bag
Eating out of garbage pails used to be a faghag
Said she danced the tango skipped the light fandango
The Zircon Princess seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peepshow watching all the creeps
So she can tell the stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got social security
She had to get a pimp she couldnt make it on her own
Dont push me cause Im close to the edge
Im trying not to lose my head ah huhhuhhuh
ah huhhuhhuh
say what
Its like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
Its like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
My brothers doing bad on my mothers TV
She says You watch it too much its just not healthy
All My Children in the daytime Dallas at night
Cant even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors they ring my phone
And scare my wife when Im not home
Got a bum education doubledigit inflation
I cant take the train to the job theres a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standin on my back
Cant stop to turn around broke my sacrophiliac
A midranged migraine cancered membrane
Sometimes I think Im going insane I swear I might hijack a plane
My son said Daddy I dont wonna go to school
Cause the teachers a jerk he must think Im a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer I think itd be cheaper
If I just got a job learned to be a street sweeper
Ill dance to the beat shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
Cause its all about money aint a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor sewed her arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I cant walk through the park cause its crazy after dark
Keep my hand on my gun cause they got me on the run
I feel like a outlaw broke my last glass jar
Hear them say You want some more livin on a seesaw
Dont push me cause Im close to the edge
Im trying not to lose my head ah huhhuhhuh
ah huhhuhhuh
say what
Its like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
Its like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smiling on you but hes frowning too
Because only God knows what youll go through
Youll grow in the ghetto living second rate
And your eyes will sing a song of deep hate
The places youre playin where you stay
Looks like one great big alley way
Youll admire all the number book takers
Thugs pimps pushers and the big money makers
Driving big cars spending twenties and tens
And you wanna grow up to be just like them huh
Smugglers scrambles burglars gamblers
Pickpockets peddlers even panhandlers
You say Im cool Im no fool
But then you wind up dropping out of high school
Now youre unemployed all nonvoid
Walking round like youre Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stickup kid look what youve done did
Got sent up for a eight year bid
Now your manhood is took and youre a may tag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Being used and abused to serve like hell
Till one day you was found hung dead in a cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young
Dont push me cause Im close to the edge
Im trying not to lose my head
Its like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder how I keep from going under
Its like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder how I keep from going under
