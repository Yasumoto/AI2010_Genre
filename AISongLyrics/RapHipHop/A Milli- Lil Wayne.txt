Im a Young Money Millionaire tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isnt fair
Im a venereal disease like a menstrual bleed
Threw the pencil and leak the sheet of the tablet in my mind
Cause I dont write shit cause I aint got time
Cause my seconds minutes hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of dat cha cha cha cha chopper
Sister Brother Son Daughter Father motha fk a copper
Got da maserati dancin on the bridge pussy poppin
Tell the coppers hahahaha you cant catch em you cant stop em

If you cant beat em then you prop em
You cant man em then you mop em
You cant stand em then you drop em
You pop em cause we pop em like Orville Redenbacher
