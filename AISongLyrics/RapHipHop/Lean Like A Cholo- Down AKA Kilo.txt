All the homies they know what I mean
Baby let me show u how I lean like a cholo

Lay back bounce in the club
When we do a dance ya we do it like what like a like a cholo

Side to side
Elbows up side to side
Elbows up side to side
Elbows up side to side
Like a cholo

All up in the club tan beat
Lookin for some hynas
We on the tree
I neeed a bad one a real freak
Find them at the dance floor so dont sleep

Damn I like u I like u but I really want her
Shes that type I can tell let me get into beat take her back to the hotel
But right now Im on the move
Show this little momma how a gangsta groove

I dont do a whole lot just enough
At least I decide to keep my elbows up
Like this and like that
All the girls know where the real gs at
You could find us way up in the back
Watching that ass bounce like a low low

I lean like a cholo
Side to side
Elbows up side to side
Elbows up side to side
Elbows up side to side
Like a cholo

Im brown I get down
The girls love how I lean
Like a G to the beat
Wondering why MJs on my feet

Im lookin real good Im so hood
Tryin to stay clean if u know what I mean

Pockets full of feria
Mucho dinero look me in the eye tell me papi te quiero

Let me do my dance u do yours
Shakin what u got till ur sweating out ur pores

Just like that ya I like that

Im a perro trying to chase that cat
Hey DJ wont u play that same track
wind it back I can lean to that

Now she wants me
And I aint going home solo cause I lean like a cholo


I lean like a cholo
Side to side
Elbows up side to side
Elbows up side to side
Elbows up side to side
Like a cholo

All the homies they know what I mean
Baby let me show u how I lean like a cholo

Lay back bounce in the club
When we do a dance ya we do it like what like a cholo

All the homies they know what I mean
Baby let me show u how I lean like a cholo

Lay back bounce in the club
When we do a dance ya we do it like what like a like a cholo


I lean like a cholo
Side to side
Elbows up side to side
Elbows up side to side
Elbows up side to side
Like a cholo
