I work the pen to make the ink transform
On any particular surface the pen lands on
Zaakir is handson whats the beef
The Cooley High cold chief high post techniques
I drape off poetic landscapes and shapes
Illustrate the paper space off the pens that paint
Then design what have a National Geographic a magic
With tailor made status and plus flavor thats automatic

Were not balling
We take it back to the days of yes yallin
We holding onto whats golden
On a stage I rage and Im rollin

Were not balling or shot calling
We take it back to the days of yes yallin
We holding onto whats golden
On a stage I rage and Im rollin

Melancholy mundane so I tame the hot flame
Big rings fat chains and yall quest for the same
No name use fame strictly new to the thang
We stay true to the game and never bring it to shame
We tight like dreadlocks or red fox and ripple
We pass participles and smash the artist in you
The saga continues this I wont get into
Cause there aint enough bars to hold the drama that we been through

Yo
We still the same with a little fame
A little change in the household name but aint too much changed
We in the game but yo not to be vain
I refrain from salt grains to season up my name
We entertain for a mutual game from close range
Steady aim drum at your head to hit the brain
Im labor ready Rhode Scholar for the dollar
Work for mines pay me by the hour

HipHop
Music
Yo
Well its the verbal Herman Munster
The word enhancer sick of phony mobsters controllin the dance floor
I been in dark places catch you when you stark naked
Your heart races as we pump you for your chart spaces
The taut taces be bringing these hot styles through
Some of you bum a few chairs from shock value
Word power can plow through acres of cornfields
Paragraphs cut like warm steel preform ill
