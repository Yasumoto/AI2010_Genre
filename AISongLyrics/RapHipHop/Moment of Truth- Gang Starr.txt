They say its lonely at the top in whatever you do
You always gotta watch motherfuckers around you
Nobodys invincible no plan is foolproof
We all must meet our moment of truth

The same sheisty cats that you hang with and do your thang with
could set you up and wet you up nigga peep the language
Its universal you play with fire it may hurt you
or burn you lessons are blessings you should learn through
Lets face facts although MCs lace tracks
it doesnt mean behind the scenes there aint no dirt to trace back
That goes for all of us there aint nobody to trust
Its like sabotage its got me ready to bust
But I cant jeapordize what I have done up to this point
So Ima get more guys to help me run the whole joint
Cultivate multiply motivate or else well die
You know I be the masterof the who what where and why
See when youre shinin some chumpsll wanna dull ya
Always selfish jealous punks will wanna pull ya
down just like some shellfish in a bucket
cause they love it to see your ass squirm like a worm
But just as youll receive what is comin to you
Everybody else is gonna get theirs too
I aint no saint therefore I cannot dispute
That everyone must meet their moment of truth

Actions have reactions dont be quick to judge
You may not know the harships people dont speak of
Its best to step back and observe with couth
For we all must meet our moment of truth

Sometimes you gotta dig deep when problems come near
Dont fear things get severe for everybody everywhere
Why do bad things happen to good people
Seems that life is just a constant war between good and evil
The situation that Im facin is mad amazin
to think such problems can arise from minor confrontations
Now Im contemplatin in my bedroom pacin
Dark clouds over my head my hearts racin
Suicide Nah Im not a foolish guy
Dont even feel like drinking or even gettin high
Cause all thats gonna do really is accelerate
the anxieties that I wish I could alleviate
But wait Ive been through a whole lot of other shit before
So I oughta be able to withstand some more
But Im sweatin though my eyes are turnin red and yo
Im ready to lose my mind but instead I use my mind
I put down the knife and take the bullets out my nine
My only crime was that Im too damn kind
And now some skanless motherfuckers wanna take whats mine
But they cant take the respect that Ive earned in my lifetime
And you know theyll never stop the furious force of my rhymes
So like they say every dog has its day
And like they say God works in a mysterious way
So I pray remembering the days of my youth
As I prepare to meet my moment of truth

Yo I got one lyric pointed at your head for start
Another one is pointed at your weak ass heart
Now if I pull the trigger on these fully loaded lines
Youre gonna wish I woulda pulled a black nine I mack dimes
Crack the spines of the fake gangsters
Yeah the bitin triflin niggaz and the studio pranksters
Yo lookin at the situation plainly will you remain G
Or will you be looked upon strangely
I reign as the articulator with the greater data
Revolvin on the TASCAM much doper than my last jam
While others struggle to juggle tricky metaphots
I explore more to expose the core
A lot of MCs act stupid to me
And we have yet to see if they can match our longevity
But anyway its just another day
Another fake jack I slay with my spectac rap display
Styles smooth but rugged  you cant push or shove it
You dig it and you dug it cause like money you love it
The king of monotone with my own throne
Righteously violent prone my words bring winds like cyclones
Stormin your hideout blockin out your sunlight
Your image and your business were truly not done right
Throw up your heAllahI now divine saviors
You got no hand skills theres no security to save ya
No pager no celly no drop top Benzy
I came to bring your phone hiphop to an ending
My art of war will leave you sore from the abuse
Cause you must meet your moment of truth

They say its lonely at the top in whatever you do
You always gotta watch motherfuckers around you
No ones untouchable no man is bulletproof
We all must meet our moment of truth
