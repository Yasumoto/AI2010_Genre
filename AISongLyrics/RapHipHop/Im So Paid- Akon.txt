Doing a 100 on the Interstate 95

Pushin that motherfkin wood cuz we certified
Got a system thatll beat and knock your wall off
Got a pump under my seat the sawedoff
Got a bunch of goons hoping they never call off
Im a sniper sitting on the roof already saw yall
It aint too much to put a strain on me
Thats the reason why I had to put the blame on me
I rather have them dollar bills rain on me
Then let them haters come and make the name of me
Thats why

Doing 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screaming Ahhh

Only to find out you live in a doll house

We bury cowards on the set that they come from
We know magic
Turn weed smoke to gun smoke
We ball first when we ride
You in a hearse when you ride
Ayyay

And Im holding down Young Mula baby
Thats why
I get it in till sunrise
Doing 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screaming Ahhh
Heyeyey Im so paid
