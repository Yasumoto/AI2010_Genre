Im a man I gotta take care of my family
Fighting these precious in my life
I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammis
But these streets wont say a goodbye
I cant say goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the hood
Goodbye
To the streets to my problems
I cant say goodbye
To the hood
Goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the streets
I cant say goodbye goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the streets
Goodbye
To the hood
I cant say goodbye
To the hood
Goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the homies
I quess its tru you cant take the hood out a homeboy
Plus my hood just lost another homeboy
Another one got life and we dont know if he coming home boy
They in the street tell me just leave it alone boy
Let them do them take care of your own boy
But I said back brake a bound before I was drome boy
You had dreams of being a dope boy
Yeah I was runnin from the po po
Banging for the turth late night huntin
Puttin me in work good day comin airbrush shirt
Pay day get the spot got my hair cut first
Made mom sick when I wouldnt go to church
Yeah I live in the burbs but I think 21st
I know since I left that its gotten much worse
But Id still be there if I couldnt write a verse
Im a man I gotta take care of my family
Fighting these precious in my life
I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammis
But these streets wont say a goodbye
To the the blocks that raise me the enemies and the homies that made
Me tough enough to hang on the corners that would moul me
Critics wonder if Im tryna be the old me
But if the thing the old me ever left then they dont really know me
And dont know we dont change we just become OG you always addicted
To the life you just dont OD I owe the streets before they owe me
Took me in when my moma didnt want me to wild to be a child and cops
Not around now all I got now is the homies to teach me how to be a man
In what not how to brake ounces in the grams
The reason Im so nice with my hands  shit you think I forgot man
Im a man I gotta take care of my family
Fighting these precious in my life
I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammis
But these streets wont say a goodbye
Thank good every day that the boy could spit
And all around the world they enjoyin my shit
I know I got plenty more wars to get
I got a beautiful wife and some gorgeous kids
But it wouldnt be right if I ignore the shit
They made me how I am the music in the man
Told me that I can for the world gave a damn
If it wasnt for my shit they sayin stick to the plan
Probably be a gun instead of a pen in my hand
Probably be doin a dub and the  with my man
The say leaders streets but they dont really understand
All I had was the block when I didnt have fans
Wrapped on the corners when I couldnt get spins
All I had was the homies when I didnt have kids
If it all come down and my carrer was to end Im sure my name
Would live in the streets
Im a man I gotta take care of my family
Fighting these precious in my life
I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammys
But these streets wont say a goodbye
I just cant say goodbye
I cant say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
I cant say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
I cant say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
I cant say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
You can take the man out the streets
But you cant take the streets out the man
