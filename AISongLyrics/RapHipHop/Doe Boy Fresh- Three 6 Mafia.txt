Now what I is boy

Another day another dollar another night to make a ho holla
I pop her cherry then I pop my collar
I pop brand new tags off of brand new clothes
Brush my hair back and kick the ho out the do
Flip a coin see which ride Im pullin up out the garage
Wireless transmitters send the bump from my ipod
Pull a pack out and fill my body up with sin
Ten oclock at night but my day has just begin
Ohseven Murcielago with the wings out
I usually never drive it but I heard the hoes out
Fresher than a mint leaf smellin like a coca leaf
Center of attention hoes smilin cause they wants to be

Hey streets know how I gets my grands
Try to snatch it better switch ya plans
Pull a stack out my Dickies pants
Slap a hater with my business hand
Keep a spare for that clip that jam
Money like Mike and pimp like Ken
Put some chrome under the big sedan
And I pimp it better than Xzibit can
And they impressed by how my ear lookin Aquafina clear
If you dont like it come dispute it do ya best to disappear
Yeah you know what it is dont call me Chamillionaire
Now the world gotta address me as the hustler of the year
Im the man to respect Im demandin respect
Or Im commandin that cannon through that damage to chest
Aint a hustler or another on the planet as fresh
So when I lift up my royal hand my pinky ring should get pecked

My cars inside peanut butter outside jelly
Flickin twentysixes drankin drankin on my celly
We takin real orders talkin codes on that telly
We choppin up that dope like a butcher in a deli
You know that purple kush leave yo clothes all smelly
But if you slangin pound then ya pockets should be swelly
Im ballin till Im fallin just like the movie Belly
Im always stayin strapped for you niggaz that be petty
Tote a nine nine nine on the grind grind grind
I shine shine shine jewelry blind blind blind
The time time time yes its prime prime prime
Im takin no retracts cause its mine mine mine nigga
