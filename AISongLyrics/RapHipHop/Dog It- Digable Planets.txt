DPS forever hit ya with the live stuff
Suliman the Bronx Ripper on the live puff
V Love thats my money like dominoes
Brooklyn do keep it rocking till the sun shows
I pop my junk my junk I pop my junk my junk
I pop my junk my junk pop my junk my junk
I pop my junk my junk like what you want you want
Pop my junk my junk I pop my junk
The noise that we made is blue in color sound
Those who play my crew couldnt walk the new found
I chalk the new sound I bop like Teddy Charles was burning
When I excuse on excursions
Arriving at the doors of mind shores of seas
Burnt you with degrees solarly
Plus my leather jacket go acid disappear in the wisp
In the mist with a fist
Proletariat Cadilac steering it
Fro soul gold Panther crew grab our poppers
Now Im making bacon
Still saying wa ah salaam ah lakum
Fresh joints we make em like water
Butter rap treasures at my leisure whatever whatever
So I gave my mind a pound cause yall we had it down
We symbolize the blessed and represent the rest
Grass in my pockets I release my hot rockets
KB said What you give em I was like Mad rhythm
Thats my junk
Eric Dolphy always hits me with the live stuff
Bahamadia back the sounds with the love love
TJ and Lisa real peoples 89 and still
In Fort Green on diamond back is where Im at
Feelin da funk da funk thats in the trunk the trunk
I feel the funk da funk feelin the funk da funk
Im feelin funk da funk Im in the trunk da trunk
Feelin da funk da funk I am the funk
I raise everyday for the mass
Tote my fist right up right against the fascist
Descend to my borough digs my diction
Its way on time pass the watch fifth line still shining
Im left this year a unknown player
In my vein lives bell hooks Derrick Bell Reggie Butler
See Marvin knew it and Sly knew it
Cube know it and now we do it outta Brooklyn
Outta sight brown sandals handle in MCs with angles
Commit to street corners where players be jay in
Im saying a Digable swinger
Word to mouth brought the clout specially in the summer
We vanish like vapor burn paper
We deal realreal so chill we linger in the funk
Yes Yes bus stop whats up watts up
On the script side
Low down the whole mix and flips I 63
Jay B and MC baby blue great
Do it fluent keep it real and straight
We make it bump de bump
We make it bump se bump
We make it pump se pump
We make it bump
Save your corny missions for the tracks you lying on
We got ammunition for the streets we dying on
Stones rocks subways blocks chill mode
Loot fold rebel wit no pause down to die for cause because
Denia gotta see a fatter day
Its Saturday Im looking at the streets as my Nikes
Cover asphalt dates wait at night
My weight crush trash broken glass
Play the wall with one foot up
Yo what up Ish Whats up
The flyer we get the higher we get
Good tryers
Is good diers that it so I move
We showed and we prove
Its groove food
Whats going on
You want to see knowledge born see C Knowledge Born
Before we fall victim we lick em
I aint playin
Meet me at the corner Murder and Adolpha
I bless you with some joints the mental hollow points
We do it in the park we do it in the park
Thats right thats right
We do it in the park we do it in the park
Im fluent after dark in any siteation
My tools jewels the nation
Thats ho we bump
