Yo yeah girl
Can you hear that Its playing our song
Are you sleepy Take a nap
Youre not afraid of the dark Are you
You hear the beat as it makes ya not wanna go to sleep
I knock on Dakotas door its locked so I go to creep
Around the back with binoulars not cause I wanna peep
But because Im hungry she smells like tacos I wanna eat
Visions of hot chocolatey marshmallows all so sweet
With sugar plums oh look here comes Marshall hes on your street
Hes placing hot smouldering charcoals beneath your feet
Now walk on em hes dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek
Like a Thanksgiving turkey or holiday ham
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast strawberry marmalade jam
Flavor my favorite graham crackers with John Bennet rams
I guess a modern day Jack the Ripper is all that I am
Cos when the lights are off I see the girls asleep My music box
But I can hear my luck you keep calling meMy music box
When were worlds apart you mean the world to meMy music box
So when you callin me I will answerMy music box
Cos when the lights are off I see the girls asleep My music box
I hear my music box playing a song for me My music box
So when she twirls around do a whirl for me My music box
You will always be my privet dancerMy music box
I almost look comatose Who wants to be sobered gross
I foam like a doberman mouth open I overdose
Put coke up my nostrils in both my holes and I plug my nose
My pupils quadruple in size eyes are so bugged I know
I put on my mothers make up get naked and run around
Wavin the gun around I think Im down to a hundred pounds
Theres thunder I wonder how come it rains but the sun is out
The devils upset with his wife they must be sluggin it out
I must be buggin the fuck out but what the fuck about
Voices are leading me up to the attic I love my house
They pull and they tug my blouse the sound of a music box
Comes from inside a toy chest but what do I do its locked
I pick it and open it but its stuffed full of human parts
I dig til I find it I wind it up and the tune just starts
Its playing a song so beautiful and the room is dark
The moon is full I smell a funeral guess Ill loom in the park
Cos when the lights are off I see the girls asleep My music box But I can hear my luck you keep calling meMy music box
When were worlds apart you mean the world to meMy music box
So when you callin me I will answerMy music box
Cos when the lights are off I see the girls asleep My music box
I hear my music box playing a song for me My music box
So when she twirls around do a whirl for me My music box
You will always be my privet dancerMy music box
Im fixated on asphyxating and breakin this little chicks
Neck like a pixie stick
The sick Satan worshippin bitches get horsewhippins
Im in the back through the back door slip in
Through the crack leavin the corpse drippin
The mortition of love sent from above
Forced entry the more wenchy the more stingy I become
Been doin this for more than a quarter century Im just numb
Am I dreamin is it real Someone pinch me on the buns
The time has come to tie her up gotta roll me the ladder
Id had enough of the chatter climb up to the window look at her
And climb in and slowly shatter her brain matter and batter her
with the bat a matter of fact that will splatter her
But before I do that Ill have a chat to flatter her
Give her two compliments backtoback like Tabatha
Im your secret admirer Im back to ravish ya
So strong is your fight but youre no match for Dracula
Prolonging her plight as I go back to stabbin her
Dismember her limbs simple as that cadaver her
Zoom in with the lens then pan back the camera
Stand back cuz here comes your man Jack so Pamela
Cos when the lights are off I see the girls asleep My music box But I can hear my luck you keep calling meMy music box
When were worlds apart you mean the world to meMy music box
So when you callin me I will answerMy music box
Cos when the lights are off I see the girls asleep My music box
I hear my music box playing a song for me My music box
So when she twirls around do a whirl for me My music box
You will always be my privet dancerMy music box
