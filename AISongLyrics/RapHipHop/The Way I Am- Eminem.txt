Whatever
Dre just let it run
Ay yo turn the beat up a little bit
Ay yo this song is for anyone
Fuck it just shut up and listen

Ay yo
I sit back with this pack of zigzags
And this bag of this weed
It gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest emcee on this on this earth
Cause since birth Ive been cursed with this curse to just cursed
And just blurt this bezerk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in its self
To relieve all this tension dispensing me
Sentence is getting it stress has been eating me recently
All through this chest and I rest to get peacefully
But at least have the decency in you to leave me alone
When you freaks see me out in the streets when Im eating or feedin my daughter
To not come and speak to me
I dont know you and no I dont owe you a motherfuckin thing
Im not Mr NSYNC and Im not what your friends think
Im not Mr Friendly
I can be a prick if you tip me my tank is on empty
No patience is in me and if you offend me Im lifting you ten feet
In the air I dont care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer file you a lawsuit
Ill smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
Im tired of arguing I dont mean to mean but its all I can be
Its just me

And I am
Whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am
In the papers the news everyday I am
Radio wont even play my jam

Cause I am
Whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am
In the papers the news everyday I am
I dont know its just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense its constant
And oh its just lyrical content
The song Guilty Conscience has gotten such rotten responses
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me
So I point one back at em
But not the index or the pinky or the ring or the thumb
Its the one you put up when you dont give a fuck
When you wont just put up with the bullshit they pull
Cause they full of shit too
When a dudes gettin bullied and shoots up your school
And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin
Where were the parents at
And look at where its at middle America
Now its a tragedy
Now its so sad to see
An upper class city having this happening
Then attack Eminem cause I rap this way
But Im glad cause they feed me the fuel
That I need for the fire to burn and its burnin and I have returned

And I am
Whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am
In the papers the news everyday I am
Radio wont even play my jam

Cause I am
Whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am
In the papers the news everyday I am
I dont know its just the way I am

Im so sick and tired of being admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And drop from my label and stop with the fables
Im not gonna be able to top what my name is
And pigeon holdin to some poppy sensations
They cop me rotation at Rock N Roll stations
And I just do not have the patience
To deal with this cocky Caucasians
Who think Im some wigga who just tries to be black
Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep asking the same fucking questions
What school did I go to
What hood I grew up in
The why The who what
When and where and the how
Till Im grabbing my hair and Im tearing it out
Youve been driving me crazy I cant take it
Im racing Im pacing I stand and I sit
And Im thankful for every fan that I get
But I cant take a shit in the bathroom
Without someone standing by it
No I wont sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole
Im glad cause

And I am
Whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am
In the papers the news everyday I am
Radio wont even play my jam

Cause I am
Whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am
In the papers the news everyday I am
I dont know its just the way I am
