paid in full
Thinkin of a master plan
Cuz aint nuthin but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pocket all my money is spent
So I dig deeper but still comin up with lint
So I start my mission leave my residence
Thinkin how could I get some dead presidents
I need money I used to be a stickup kid
So I think of all the devious things I did
I used to roll up this is a hold up aint nuthin funny
Stop smiling be still dont nuthin move but the money
But now I learned to earn cos Im righteous
I feel great so maybe I might just
Search for a 9 to 5 if I strive
Then maybe Ill stay alive
So I walk up the street whistlin this
Feelin out of place cos man do I miss
A pen and a paper a stereo a tape of
Me and Eric B and a nice big plate of
Fish which is my favorite dish
But without no money its still a wish
Cos I dont like to dream about gettin paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I made
To now test to see if I got pull
Hit the studio cos Im paid in full
