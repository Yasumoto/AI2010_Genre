Ready Or Not  Here I Come  You Can t Hide
Gonna Find You and Take it Slowly
Ready Or Not  Here I Come  You Can t Hide
Gonna Find You and Make you want me


Now that I escape  sleepwalker awake
Those who could relate know the world ain t cake
Jail bars ain t golden gates
Those who fake  they break
When they meet their 400 pound mate
If I could rule the world
Everyone would have a gun in the ghetto of course
When giddyupin  on their horse
I Kick a rhyme drinkin  moonshine
I pour a sip on the concrete  for the deceased
But no don t weep  Wyclef s in a state of sleep
Thinkin   bout the robbery that I did last week
Money in the bag  banker looked like a drag
I want to play with pelicans from here to Baghdad
Gun blast  think fast  I think I m hit
My girl pinched my hips to see if I still exist
I think not  I ll send a letter to my friends
A born again hooligan only to be king again


I play my enemies like a game of chess  where I rest
No stress
If you don t smoke sess  lest
I must confess  my destiny s manifest
In some Goretex and sweats I make treks like I m homeless
Rap orgies with Porgy and Bess
Capture your bounty like Elliot Ness  YES
Bless you if you represent the Fu
But I ll hex you with some witch s brew if you re Doo Doo
Voo Doo
I can do what you do  easy  BELIEVE ME
Frontin  niggas give me hee bee gee bees
So while you re imitating Al Capone
I ll be Nina Simone
And defacating on your microphone


Ready Or Not  Here I Come  You Can t Hide
Gonna Find You and Take it Slowly


You can t run away
From these styles I got  oh baby  hey baby
Cause I got a lot  oh yeah
And anywhere you go
My whole crew s gonna know
You can t hide from the block  oh no

Ready or not  refugees takin  over
The Buffalo soldier  dread lock rhasta
On the twelfth hour  fly by in my bomber
Crews run for cover  now they re under pushin  up flowers
Superfly true lies  do or die
Toss me high   only puff la
With my crew from lock high
I refugee from Guantanamo Bay
Dance around the border like I m Cassius Clay

Ready Or Not  Here I Come  You Can t Hide
Gonna Find You and Take it Slowly
Ready Or Not  Here I Come  You Can t Hide
Gonna Find You and Make You Want Me
