Now in my younger days I used to sport a shag
When I went to school I carried lunch in a bag
With an apple for my teacher cause I knew Id get a kiss
Always got mad when the class was dismissed
But when it was in session I always had a question
I would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and
help me with my problem it was never much
Just a trick to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch
Oh how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug
She was married to the man he was a thug
His name was Lee he drove a Z
hed pick her up from school promptly at three oclock
I was on her jock yes indeedy I wrote graffiti on the bus
First Id write her name then carve a plus
with my name last on the looking glass
I seen her yesterday but still I had to let her pass
She keeps on passin me by
When I dream of fairytales I think of me and Shelly
See shes my type of hype and I cant stand when brothers tell me
That I should quit chasin and look for something better
But the smile that she shows makes me a gogetter
I havent gone as far as asking if I could get with her
I just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture
Im shootin for her heart got my finger on the trigger
She could be my broad and I could be her nigga
But all I can do is stare
Back as kids we used to kiss when we played truth or dare
Now shes more sophisticated highly edumacated
not at all overrated I think I need a prayer
to get in her boots and it looks rather dry
I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye
Although shes crazy steppin Ill try to stop her stride
Cause I wont have no more of this passin me by
And I must voice my opinion of not even pretending she didnt have me
Strung like a chicken chase my tail like a doggie
She was kind of like a star thinking I was like a fan
Dude she looked good down side she had a man
He was a rootytoot a nincompoop
She told me soon your little birdies gonna fly the coop
She was a flake like corn and I was born not to understand
By lettin her pass I had proved to be a better man
She keeps on passin me by
Now there she goes again the dopest Ethiopian
And now the world around me be gets movin in slow motion
whenever she happens to walk by  why does the apple of my eye
overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try
Wait no i did not really pursue my little princess with persistance
And I was so lowkey that she was unaware of my existance
From a distance I desired secretly admired her
Wired her a letter to get her and it went
My dear my dear my dear you do not know me but I know you very well
Now let me tell you about the feelings I have for you
When I try or make some sort of attempt I symp
Damn I wish I wasnt such a wimp
Cause then I would let you know that I love you so
And if I was your man then I would be true
The only lying I would do is in the bed with you
Then I signed sincerely the one who loves you dearly PS love me tender
The letter came back three days later Return to Sender
Damn
She keeps on passin me by
