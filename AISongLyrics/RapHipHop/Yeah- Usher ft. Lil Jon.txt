Up in the club with my homies try to get a lil VI but keep it down on the low key cause you know how it is
I saw shorty she was checkin up on me from the game she was spittin in my ear you would think that she knew me
So we decided to chill

Conversation got heavy she had me feelin like shes ready to blow
Watch Out Oh Watch Out
Shes saying Come get me Come get me
So I got up and followed her to the floor she said Baby lets go
when I told her I said

Yeah yeah Shorty got down low and said come and get me
Yeah yeah I got so caught up I forgot she told me
Yeah yeah Her and my girl used to be the best of homies
Yeah yeah Next thing I knew she was all up on me screaming

Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeaah

So shes all up in my head now got me thinking that it might be a good idea to take her with me
Cause shes ready to leave ready to leave
But I gotta keep it real now cause on a one to ten shes a certified twenty but that just aint me Hey

Because I dont know if I take that chance just where its gonna lead
But what I do know is the way she dance makes shorty alright with me
