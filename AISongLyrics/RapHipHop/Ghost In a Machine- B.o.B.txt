Tell me where am I supposed to go
And who am I supposed to believe
If only you knew what I knew
Then you could see just what I see
So I grab my bags and go as far away as I can go
Cause everything aint what I used to know
And I try to hide but I just cant hide no more
Theres nothing worse than feeling like a ghost
You say I look fine if only you knew whats on my mind
Youd see a whole different sign I couldnt show you even if I tried
I must have got lost in time when I found out I was only free to be where ever I want to be
Some say Im out of sight how I run and that were all so blind
If you could open up your eyes you could see what I couldnt describe
And then youd see the signs and then your soul would be set free and then youd be released
So I grab my bags and go as far away as I can go
Cause everything aint what I used to know
And I try to hide but I just cant hide no more
Theres nothing worse than feeling like a ghost
Tell me where am I supposed to go
And who am I supposed to believe
If only you knew what I knew
Then you could see Hey
So I grab my bags and go as far away as I can go
Cause everything aint what I used to know
And I try to hide but I just cant hide no more
Theres nothing worse than feeling like a ghost
And Im terrified like Ive seen a UFO
Cause everything aint what I used to know
And I try to hide but I just cant hide no more
Theres nothing worse than feeling like a ghost
I go
A UFO
And Im so tired of hiding Ive been running Ive been trying to get away to get away
So I grab my bags and go as far away as I can go
Cause everything aint what I used to know
And I try to hide but I just cant hide no more
Theres nothing worse than feeling like a ghost
