Why should I feel discouraged
Why should the shadows come
Why should my heart fell lonely
And long for heaven and home

When Jesus is my portion
A constant friend is he
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know he watches over me
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know he watches me


I sing because Im happy
I sing because Im free
His eye is on the sparrow

And I know he watches
He watches me
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know he watches
I know he watches
I know he watches me

I sing because Im happy
I sing because Im free
His eye is on the sparrow

And I know he watches me
He watches me
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know he watches me
He watches me
He watches me I never thought
He watches me
