Mama always told me I was crazy
And my hoes say Im amazing but I dont listen to a lady
But the bitch say Im hot and I say No bitch Im blazin
Like what the fk you expect Im a motherfkin Cajun
I feel caged in my mind its like my flow doin time
I goes crazy inside but when it comes out its fine
Like lyingwait  watch see I get better with time like a watch
Oshbegosh Posh Spice husband couldnt kick it like I kick it bitch
I kicks it no serial like a landing I sticks it
Whatever she asks me after she licks it
Thats too explicit  but why you listening
I smell smoke and something sizzling
Thats her pussy so hey pussy play with pussy or play pussy
They say youre nobody til somebody kills you
But where Im from youre nobody til you kill somebody
And you know what they say when you great its not murder its assassinate
So assassinate me bitch cuz Im doing the same shit that Martin Luther King did
Checkin in the same hotel in the same suite bitch
Same balcony like Assassinate me bitch
Its Lil Tune  I dont rap I fill movies with my rap
You can call me Mr Directors Chair yeah and thats a wrap
Cut onto the next not the next scene  bitch the next check
Some say the x makes the sex spec so play with the pussy or play pussy
Straight off the corner of Apple and Eagle
Pray for a bitch like the times are Medieval
Married to the block divorced the cathedral
Standin on the corner selling porcelain to people
Forced into evil its all in ya head
Its all so cerebral call me Knievel
You follow when I leave you straight to the needle
The bottle the battle the beetlesll eat you
Momma name Cita I love you Cita
Member when your pussy second husband use to beat ya
Member when I went into the kitchen got the cleaver
He aint give a fk I aint give a fk either
He could see the devil see the devil in my features
You can smell the ether you can see Cita
You can see the Cita see the Cita in my features
And she dont play neither
