Look if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip Yo

His palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy
Theres vomit on his sweater already moms spaghetti
Hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs but he keeps on forgettin
What he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words wont come out
Hes chokin how everybodys jokin now
The clocks runs out times up over Blow
Snap back to reality oh there goes gravity
Oh there goes Rabbit he choked hes so mad
But he wont give it up that easy no he wont have it
He knows his whole backs to these ropes it dont matter hes dope
He knows that but hes broke hes so stagnant that he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home thats when its
Back to the lab again yo this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it dont pass him

You better lose yourself in the music the moment
You own it you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music the moment
You own it you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

The souls escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring but superstardoms
Close to postmortem it only grows harder
Only grows hotter he blows us all over
These hoes is all on him coast to coast shows
Hes known as the globetrotter lonely roads god only
Knows hes grown farther from home hes no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water
These hoes dont want him no mo hes cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows he nose
Dove and sold nada so the soap opera
Is told and unfolds I suppose its old partner
But the beat goes on da da dum da dum da da

You better lose yourself in the music the moment
You own it you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music the moment
You own it you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

No more games Im a change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin roof off like 2 dogs caged
I was playin in the beginnin the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebodys payin the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I cant get by with my nine to
Five and I cant provide the right type of
Life for my family cuz man these goddamn
Food stamps dont buy diapers and theres no movie
Theres no Mekhi Phifer this is my life
And these times are so hard and its getting even harder
Tryin to feed and water my seed plus teetertotter
Caught up between bein a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama screamin on and too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point Im like a snail Ive got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin option failures not
Mom I love you but this trailers got to go
I cannot grow old in Salems Lot
So here I go its my shot feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music the moment
You own it you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music the moment
You own it you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better

You can do anything you set your mind to man
