Somebodys gotta be there when it gets ugly
Somebodys gotta be there when it gets bloody
Somebodys gotta get their hands dirty
Yo its a fucked up job but somebodys gotta do it
Somebodys gotta come up with a plan
And be there when the shit hits the fan
I hope yall out there understand
Look man its a fucked up job but somebodys gotta do it

Yeah yall ideal for a lyrical perfectionist
Raw thats what every soldier in my collective is
Thought control level is that of a gold medalist
My level headedness make it come off so effortless
The rebel is a opposite extreme of devilish
Back setting it with the answer to your deficit
My track record is hot shit consecutive
Smug I got game just like a record executive
A kiss to the feminine girls loving a gentlemen
A genius slash gangsta with a skill for swindling
Bet on Black
Bet these cats thats all gelatin
Will fall back spittin them raps thats unintelligent
Raps that cap rabid rattlin out the gattlin
Crippling rhymes whistlin past blow you back in
Smellin your blood now Im huntin
Blowin your front in for frontin what up cousin
Oh now its nothin
Yo you cant go beyond a point of no returning
I flip like my name Turner
Thats for certain nigga Ted Turner Nat Turner nigga Ike Turner
The raw sojourner for truth
The mic burner

Mic malevolence defies violence I inherited
Others just rentin it like rooms at the Sheraton
I gotta jones like Vanessa in the devil in
And yall cold like a show in the Netherlands
Cold shoulders and frozen aortic valves
So I dont form pals  conform to norms  morals different
Gifted  use it to shift shit a mutant shape shifter when I spit it Im liquid
You could lick a million shots at the character of the body shell
Theyll just richochette nigga auras hard as hell
Before there was aint hard to tell
The mics cycle coincided right with mine as well
Since a minor I walked with the spine upstraight
I learned to rhyme to feed the dinner plate
I scraped barrel  even dined up on wine and steaks
Cuz in the bone same marrow that apartheid chased
The narrow margin with the haves and the have nots
Will get smaller as I approach  so watch your stash box
Fox logo if your fave is local
Get bruised till youre the color of the Lakers logo
This is work niggas

I made it  aint nobody believe in me
But this rap game is like selling coke legally
Aint no innovations  that takes concentration
Niggas celebrating not knowing the time they wasting
Killin mics is one of my aesthetics
Rip very live so Im an entertainer like Cedric
Shit they play on radios now give me a headache
Cant slow me down I know where Im headed
The profit on kill if you let it
Niggas feeling energetic
Wanna rumble  guns will come out
Here come the paramedics
Im just trying to live like Ive Devin
Tired of my people failin
We all sin  the devil what di I tell em
Somebody gotta get their hands dirty and shoes muddy
I see things vividly yall vision is blurry
Even if you hate  through my music you gone love
Everybody with me and they was with me when it was ugly
