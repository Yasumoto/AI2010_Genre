Crush a bit little bit roll it up take a hit
Feelin lit feelin light 2 am summer night
I dont care hand on the wheel drivin drunk Im doin my thang
Rollin the Midwest side and out livin my life getting out dreams
People told me slow my roll Im screaming out fuck that
Imma do just what I want lookin ahead no turnin back
if I fall if I die know I lived it to the fullest
if I fall if I die know I lived and missed some bullets

Im on the pursuit of happiness and I know everything that shine aint always gonna be gold
Ill be fine once I get it Ill be good

Tell me what you know about dreamin dreamin
you dont really know about nothin nothin
tell me what you know about them night terrors every night
5 am cold sweats wakin up to the skies
tell me what you know about dreams dreams
tell me what you know about night terrors nothin
you dont really care about the trials of tomorrow
rather lay awake in a bed full of sorrow

Im on the pursuit of happiness and I know everything that shines aint always gonna be gold
Ill be fine once I get it Ill be good

Im on the pursuit of happiness I know everything that shines aint always gold
Ill be fine once I get it Ill be good

Im on the pursuit of happiness and I know everything that shines aint always gonna be gold hey
Ill be fine once I get it yeah Ill be good

Im on the pursuit of happiness
And I know everything that shines aint always gonna be gold hey
Ill be fine once I get it yeah
Ill be good

Pursuit of happiness yeah
I dont get it Ill be good
