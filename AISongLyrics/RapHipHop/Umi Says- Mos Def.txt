Tomorrow may never come
For you or me life is not promised
Tomorrow may never show up
For you and me this life is not promised
I aint no perfect man
Im trying to do the best that I can
With what it is I have
I aint no perfect man
Im trying to do the best that I can
With what it is I have
Put my heart and soul into this song
Yes yes
I hope you feel me from where I am to wherever you are
I mean that sincerely tomorrow may never come
For you and me life is not promised tomorrow may never appear
You better hold this very moment very close to you
Right now

Your moment in history is right now now
Dont be afraid to let it shine
My Umi said Shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see
My Abi said Shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see
I want black people to be free to be free to be free
My Abi said Shine your light on the world
Want black people to be free to be free to be free
Shine your light for the world to see
Want black people to be free to be free to be free
My Umi said Shine your light on the world
Want black people to be free to be free to be free
Shine your light for the world to see
Want black people to be free to be free
Sometimes I get discouraged
I look around and things are so weak
People are so weak
Sometimes sometimes I feel like crying
Sometimes my heart gets heavy
Sometimes I just want to leave and fly away
Fly fly fly like a dove
Sometimes I dont know what to do with myself
Ow
Passion takes over me I feel like a man
Going insane losing my brain
Trying to maintain doing my thang
Hey hey hey hey hey
Put my heart and soul into this yall
I hope you feel me where I am to wherever you are
Sometimes I dont want to be bothered
Sometimes I just want a quiet life
With me and my babies me and my lady
Sometimes I dont want to get into no war
Black people to be free to be free to be free
Sometimes I dont wanna be a soldier
Sometimes I just wanna be a man but
Umi said Shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see
My Abi said Shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see
I want black people to be free to be free to be free
My dreamers say Shine your light on the world
Want black people to be free to be free to be free
Shine your light for the world to see
Want black people
My elders said Shine your light on the world
Hey hey
