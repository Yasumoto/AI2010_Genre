Baby the clock on the wall is lying
Its not really that late
Its too cold outside to be walking around
the streets of this town
Anywhere if you think you have to be can wait
Baby Why dont you stay with me
Share all your secrets tonight
We can make believe the morning sun never will rise
Come and lay your head on this big brass bed
And well be alright as long as you stay with me yeah
Baby theres just no use in hiding
The way that I am feeling right now
With you standing there baby I swear I cant help but stare
Girl youre wearing me out wearing me out
Baby So why dont you stay with me share all your secrets tonight
We can make believe
the morning sun never will rise
Come and lay your head on this big brass bed
Well be alright as long as you stay with me
Baby dont go it looks like its starting to rain
And its so warm here in this apartment wrapped up in this blanket
Baby Why dont you stay with me
Share all your secrets tonight
We can make believe the morning sun never will rise
Come and lay your head on this big brass bed
And well be alright as long as you stay with me yeah
Stay with me
