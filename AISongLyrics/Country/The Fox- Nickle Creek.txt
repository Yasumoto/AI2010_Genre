The fox ran out on a chilly night
He prayed for the moon to give him light
For he had many amile to go that night
Before he reached the towno towno towno
Many amile to go that night before he reached the towno

He ran till he came to the farmers pen
The ducks and the geese were kept there and
He said one of you are gonna grease my chin
before I leave this towno towno towno
One of you are gonna grease my chin before I leave this towno

He grabbed the grey goose by the neck
He threw a duck actoss his back
And he didnt mind the quack quack
And the legs all dangling downo downo downo
He didnt mind the quack quack
And the legs all dangling downo

Well the old grey woman jumped outta bed
And out the window she popped her head
Crying Johnny John the grey goose is gone
The fox is on the towno towno towno
Johnny John the grey goose is gone
The fox is on the towno

He ran till he came to his nice warm bed
And there were the little ones 8910
Saying daddy daddy better go back again
It must be a mighty fine towno towno towno
Daddy daddy go back again
It must be a mighty fine towno

The fox and his wife without any strife
Cut up the goose with a fork and a knife
They never had such a supper in their life
And the little ones chewed on the boneso boneso boneso
They never had such a supper in their life
And the little ones chewed on the boneso
