Out in the country past the city limits sign
Well theres a honky tonk near the county line
The joint starts jumpin everynight when the sun goes down
They got whiskey women music and smoke
Its where all the cowboys go to boot scootin boogie

Ive got a good job I work hard for my money
When its quittin time I hit the door runnin
I fire up my pickup truck and let the horses run
I go flyin down that highway to that hideaway
Stuck out in the woods to do the boot scootin boogie


Yeah  heel  toe  docie doe come on baby lets go boot scootin
Oh  Cadilac black jack  baby meet me outback were gonna boogie
Oh get down  turn around go to town boot scootin boogie

The bartender asks me says son whatll it be
I want a shot at that redhead yonder lookin at me
The dance floors hoppin and its hotter than the fourth of July
I see outlaws  inlaws crooks and straights all out makin it shake
Doin the boot scootin boogie

Oh  heel  toe  docie doe come on baby lets go boot scootin
Cadilac black jack  baby meet me outback were gonna boogie
Yeah  get down  turn around go to town boot scootin boogie
