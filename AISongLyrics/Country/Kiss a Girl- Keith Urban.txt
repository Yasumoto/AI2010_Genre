To kiss and tell its just not my style
But the night is young and its been awhile
And she broke my heart broke it right in two
And it took some time but Im feeling like Im
Finally ready to find find somebody new

I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Dont wanna go too far just take it slow
But I shouldnt be lonely in this big ol world
I wanna kiss a girl

Its that moment when you start closin in
First youre holding back then surrendering
It can start a fire light up the sky
Such a simple thing do you wanna try
Are you ready to
Say goodbye to all these rules

Cause maybe tonight
It could turn into the rest of our lives oh yeah
Are you ready
Are you ready
To cross that line put your lips on mine
Put your lips on mine baby
Do you wanna try
Are you ready to
Say goodbye to all these rules

I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight maybe make a little magic baby
Dont wanna go to far just take it slow
But no one should be lonely I shouldnt be lonely
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Dont wanna go too far just take it slow
But I shouldnt be lonely in this big ol world
I wanna kiss a girl
I said I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
I wanna make a little magic out under the moonlight
Mmm I wanna kiss her now
