All he could think about was
Im too young for this
Got my whole life ahead
Hell Im just a kid myself
How m I gonna raise one
All he could see were his dreams
Going up in smoke
So much for ditchin this town
An hangin out on the coast
Oh well those plans are long gone
And he said There goes my life
There goes my future my everything
Might as well kiss it all goodbye
There goes my life
A couple years of up all night
An a few thousand diapers later
That mistake he thought he made
Covers up the refrigerator
Oh yeah he loves that little girl
An Mommas waiting to tuck her in
As she fumbles up those stairs
She smiles back at him
Dragging that teddy bear
Sleep tight Blue eyes and bouncing curls
An he smiles There goes my life
There goes my future my everything
I love you Daddy goodnight
There goes my life
She had that Honda loaded down
With Abercrombie clothes
An and fifteen pairs of shoes
An his American Express
He checked the oil and slammed the hood
Said Youre good to go
She hugged them both
And headed off to the west coast
An he cried There goes my life
There goes my future my everything
I love you baby goodbye
There goes my life
There goes my life
Baby goodbye
Fades
