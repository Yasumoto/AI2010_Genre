I drove a herd of cattle down from old Nebraska way
Thats how I come to be in the state of Iowa
I met a gal in Iowa her eyes were big and blue
I asked her what her name was she said Sioux City Sue
Sioux City Sue Sioux City Sue
Your hair is red your eyes are blue
Id swap my horse and dog for you
Sioux City Sue Sioux City Sue
There aint no gal as true as my sweet Sioux City Sue
I asked her if she had a beau she said Yes quite a few
But still I started courtin my sweet Sioux City Sue
The first time that I stole a kiss I caught her stealing two
I asked her did she love me She said Indeed I do
Sioux City Sue Sioux City Sue
Your hair is red your eyes are blue
Id swap my horse and dog for you
Sioux City Sue my Sioux City Sue
There aint no gal as true as my sweet Sioux City Sue
Im admitting Iowa I owe a lot to you
Cause I come from Nebraska to find Sioux City Sue
Im gonna rope and tie her up Ill use my old lasso
Im gonna put my brand on my sweet Sioux City Sue
Sioux City Sue Sioux City Sue
Your hair is red your eyes are blue
Id swap my horse and dog for you
Sioux City Sue my Sioux City Sue
There aint no gal as true as my sweet Sioux City Sue
