driving down the interstate
running thirty minutes late
singing margaritaville and minding my own
some foriegn car driving dude
with a road rage attitude
pulled up beside me talking on his cell phone
he started yellin at me
like i did something wrong
he flipped me the bird
and then he was gone
some beach somewhere
theres a big umbrella casting shade over an empty chair
palm trees are growing
warm breeze is blowing
i picture myself right there
on some beach somewhere
i circled the parking lot tryin to find a spot
just big enough i could park my old truck
a man with a big cigar was gettin into his car
i stopped an i waited for him to back up
from out of no where a mercedes benz
came cruisin up and whipped right in
some beach somewhere
theres a big umbrella casting shade over an empty chair
palm trees are growing
warm breeze is blowing
i picture myself right there
on some beach somewhere
theres cold marguritas and hot senioritas waiting there
i sit in that waiting room it seemed like all afternoon
nurse finally said docs ready for you
but he stuck that needle down into my gum
and he started drillin before it was numb
some beach somewhere
theres a big umbrella casting shade over an empty chair
palm trees are growing
warm breeze is blowing
i picture myself right there
on some beach somewhere
theres a beautiful sunset burnin up the atmosphere
theres music
on some beach
somewhere
