you better take it from me that boy is like a disease
youre running youre trying youre trying to hide
and youre wondering why you cant get free
hes like a curse hes like a drug
you get addicted to his love
you wanna get out but hes holding you down
cause you cant live without one more touch
hes a good time cowboy casanova
leaning up against the record machine
looks like a cool drink of water
but hes candy coated misery
hes the devil in disguise
a snake with blue eyes
and he only comes out at night
gives you feelings that you dont want to fight
you better run for your life
i see that look on your face
you aint hearing what i say
so ill say it again
cause i know where you been
and i know how it ends
you cant get away
dont even look in his eyes
hell tell you nothing but lies
and you wanna believe
but you wont be deceived
if you listen to me
and take my advice
hes a good time cowboy casanova
leaning up against the record machine
looks like a cool drink of water
but hes candy coated misery
hes the devil in disguise
a snake with blue eyes
and he only comes out at night
gives you feelings that you dont want to fight
you better run for your life
run run away
dont let him mess with your mind
hell tell you anything you want to hear
hell break your heart
its just a matter of time
but just remember
hes a good time cowboy casanova
leaning up against the record machine
looks like a cool drink of water
but hes candy coated misery
hes the devil in disguise
a snake with blue eyes
and he only comes out at night
gives you feelings that you dont want to fight
you better run for your life
oh you better run for your life
oh you better run for your life
