basstrackers bayliners and a party barge
strung together like a floating trailer park anchored out and gettin loud
all summer long side by side theres five
houseboat front porches astroturf
lawn chairs and tiki torches
regular joes rocking the boat thats us
the redneck yacht club
when the partys over and were all alone
well be making waves in a no wake zone
basstrackers bayliners and a party barge
strung together like a floating trailer park anchored out and gettin loud
all summer long side by side theres five
houseboat front porches astroturf
lawn chairs and tiki torches
regular joes rocking the boat thats us
the redneck yacht club
