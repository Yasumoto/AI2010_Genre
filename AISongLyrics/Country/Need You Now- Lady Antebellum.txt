Picture perfect memories scattered all around the floor
Reachin for the phone cause I cant fight it anymore
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time
Its a quarter after one Im all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldnt call but I lost all control and I need you now
And I dont know how I can do without
I just need you now
Another shot of whiskey cant stop looking at the door
Wishing youd come sweeping in the way you did before
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time
Its a quarter after one Im a little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldnt call but I lost all control and I need you now
And I dont know how I can do without
I just need you now
woah woaaah
Guess Id rather hurt than feel nothin at all
Its a quarter after one Im all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldnt call but Im a little drunk and I need you now
And I dont know how I can do without
I just need you now
I just need you now
Ooo baby I need you now
