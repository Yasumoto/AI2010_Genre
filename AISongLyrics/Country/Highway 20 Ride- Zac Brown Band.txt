I ride east every other Friday but if i had it my way
The day would not be wasted on this drive
And i want so bad to hold you
Son theres things I havent told you
Your mom and me couldnt get along
So ill drive
And I think about my life
And wonder why That I slowly die inside
Everytime I turn that truck around right at the Georgia line and i count the days and the miles back home to you on that Highway 20 ride
A day might come and youll realize that if you could see through my eyes
There was no other way to work it out
And a part of you might hate me
But son please dont mistake me For a man that didnt care at all
And ill drive
And Ill think about my life
And wonder why That I slowly die inside
Everytime I turn that truck around right at the Georgia line and i count the days and the miles back home to you on that Highway 20 ride
So when you drive
And the years go flying by
I hope you smile
If i ever cross your mind
It was a pleasure of my life
And i cherished every time
And my whole world
It begins and ends with you
On that Highway 20 ride
