We call them cool
Those hearts that have no scars to show
The ones that never do let go
And risk it the tables being turned

We call them fools
Who have to dance within the flame
Who chance the sorrow and the shame
That always come with getting burned

But you got to be tough when consumed by desire
Cause its not enough just to stand outside the fire
We call them strong
Those who can face this world alone
Who seem to get by on their own
Those who will never take the fall

We call them weak
Who are unable to resist
The slightest chance love might exist
And for that forsake it all

Theyre so hell bent on giving walking a wire
Convinced its not living if you stand outside the fire

Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried it is merely survived
If youre standing outside the fire

Theres this love that is burning
Deep in my soul
Constantly yearning to get out of control
Wanting to fly hiher and higher
I cant abide standing outside the fire

Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried it is merely survived
If youre standing outside the fire

Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried it is merely survived
If youre standing outside the fire
