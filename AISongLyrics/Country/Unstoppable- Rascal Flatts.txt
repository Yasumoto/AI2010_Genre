Youre on the phone with your girlfriend shes upset
Shes going off about something that you said
Cause she doesnt get your humor like I do
Im in the room its a typical Tuesday night
Im listening to the kind of music she doesnt like
And shell never know your story like I do
But she wears short skirts I wear Tshirts
Shes Cheer Captain and Im on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what youre looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that Im the one who understands you
Been here all along so why cant you see
You you belong with me you belong with me
Walking the streets with you and your wornout jeans
I cant help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
Hey isnt this easy
And youve got a smile that could light up this whole town
I havent seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say youre fine I know you better than that
Hey what ya doing with a girl like that
She wears high heels I wear sneakers
Shes Cheer Captain and Im on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what youre looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that Im the one who understands you
Been here all along so why cant you see
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know
Baby you belong with me you belong with me
Oh I remember you driving to my house in the middle of the night
Im the one who makes you laugh when you know youre bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs and you tell me bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong think I know its with me
Cant you see that Im the one who understands you
Been here all along so why cant you see
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know
Baby you belong with me you belong with me
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me
