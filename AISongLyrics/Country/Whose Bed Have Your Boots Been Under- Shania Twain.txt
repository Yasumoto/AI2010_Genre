Whose bed have your boots been under
Whose bed have your boots been under
And whose heart did you steal I wonder
This time did it feel like thunder baby
Whose bed have your boots been under

Dont look so lonely
Dont act so blue
I know Im not the only
Girl you run to
I know about Lolita
Your little Spanish flame
Ive seen you around with Rita
The redhead down the lane

Whose bed have your boots been under
And whose heart did you steal I wonder
This time did it feel like thunder baby
And who did you run to
And whose lips have you been kissin
And whose ear did you make a wish in
Is she the one that youve been missin baby
Well whose bed have your boots been under

I heard youve been sneakin
Around with Jill
And what about that weekend
With Beverly Hill
And Ive seen you walkin
With long legs Louise
And you werent just talkin
Last night with Denise

Whose bed have your boots been under
And whose heart did you steal I wonder
This time did it feel like thunder baby
And who did you run to
And whose lips have you been kissin
And whose ear did you make a wish in
Is she the one that youve been missin baby
Well whose bed have your boots been under

Come on boots

So next time youre lonely
Dont call on me
Try the operator
Maybe shell be free

Whose bed have your boots been under
And whose heart did you steal I wonder
This time did it feel like thunder baby
And who did you run to
And whose lips have you been kissin
And whose ear did you make a wish in
Is she the one that youve been missin baby
Well whose bed have your boots been under

I wanna know whose bed baby
Whoa baby tell me
Whose bed yes I wanna know
You better start talkin
Or you better start walkin
