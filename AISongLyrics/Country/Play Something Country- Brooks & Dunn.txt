Yes she blew through the door like TNT
Put her hand on her hip pointed a finger at me
Said Im a whiskey drinkin cowboy chasin helluva time
I like Kenny Keith Allan and Patsy Cline
Im a full grown Queen Bee lookin for honey
Haoho aw play somethin country
Yeah the band took a break
The DJ played P Diddy
She said I didnt come here to hear
Somethin thumpin from the city
Said I shaved my legs I paid my money
Haoho play somethin country
Haoho aw play somethin country
Crank up the band play the steel guitar
Hank it up a little lets rock this bar
Threw back a shot yelled Im a George Strait junkie
Haoho play somethin country
Haoho aw play somethin country
Yeah the bartender yelled Yall its closin time
She got this wild look on her face
An said Your truck or mine
I know a place down the road
Its kinda funky
Haoho all out in the country
Haoho now play somethin country
Crank up the band play the steel guitar
Crank it up a little lets rock this bar
Threw back a shot yelled Im a George Strait junkie
Haoho play somethin country
Haoho now play somethin country
Crank up the band play the steel guitar
Hank it up a little lets rock this bar
Threw back a shot yelled Im a George Strait junkie
Ahoho play somethin country
Haoho play somethin
