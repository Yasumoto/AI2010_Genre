She walks to school with the lunch she packed
Nobody knows what shes holdin back
Wearin the same dress she wore yesterday
She hides the bruises with linen and lace
The teacher wonders but she doesnt ask
Its hard to see the pain behind the mask
Bearing the burden of a secret storm
Sometimes she wishes she was never born
Through the wind and the rain
She stands hard as a stone
In a world that she cant rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place where shes loved
Concrete angel
Somebody cries in the middle of the night
The neighbors hear but they turn out the lights
A fragile soul caught in the hands of fate
When morning comes itll be too late
A statue stands in a shaded place
An angel girl with an upturned face
A name is written on a polished rock
A broken heart that the world forgot
