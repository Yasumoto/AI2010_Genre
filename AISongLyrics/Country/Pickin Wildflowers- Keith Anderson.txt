Hey baby whatcha doin this evening
Can you meet me down at the railroad tracks
I got Tom Petty playin in my Silverado
And I iced down a sixpack
Hey Daisy dont you worry bout your mama
Like 007 we can keep it covert
Undercover on the ground by the water
Gonna get a little peace on earth
Baby whatcha say we go pickin wildflowers
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
You and me baby pickin wildflowers
Hey baby Mother Nature is waitin
And loves bloomin like a cherry tree
Lets buzz around maybe do some pollenating
Dive on in like honey bees
Baby whatcha say we go pickin wildflowers
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
You and me baby pickin wildflowers
Take a trail ride if you know what I mean
Hey baby wont you come with me
Baby whatcha say we go pickin wildflowers
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
You and me baby pickin wildflowers
Baby whatcha say we go pickin wildflowers
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
You and me baby pickin wildflowers
