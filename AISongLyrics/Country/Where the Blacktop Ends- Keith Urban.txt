gonna kick off my shoes
and run in bare feet
where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet
goin back to the well gonna visit old friends
and feed my soul where the blacktop ends
im lookin down the barrel of friday night
ridin on a river of freeway lights
goodbye city im country bound
til monday rolls around
gonna kick off my shoes
and run in bare feet
where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet
goin back to the well gonna visit old friends
and feed my soul where the blacktop ends
workin in the grind is an uphill road
punchin that clock and carryin that load
i bust it all week and then im free
the weekend belongs to me
gonna kick off my shoes
and run in bare feet
where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet
goin back to the well gonna visit old friends
and feed my soul where the blacktop ends
so come on and give me some fresh air give me that farm
give me some time with you in my arms
far away from the hustle and the pressure and the noise
gonna kick off my shoes
and run in bare feet
where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet
goin back to the well gonna visit old friends
and feed my soul you betcha
gonna kick off my shoes
and run in bare feet
where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet
goin back to the well gonna visit old friends
and feed my soul where the blacktop ends
where the blacktop ends
where the blacktop ends
