Imagine a dirt road full of potholes
with a creek bank
And some cane poles catchin channel cat
Im a little more country than that
Picture a small town with an old hound
Layin out front of the courthouse while
the old men chew the fat
Im a little more country than that
I just want to make sure you know just who
youre gettin under this old hat
Cause girl Im not the kind to twotime or play
games behind your back
Im a little more country than that
Think of a Hank song from days gone
With the steel ride thats so strong it sends
chills up your back
Im a little more country than that
If you want a brick home in a school zone
With the doors locked and alarms on girl
youre way off track
Im a little more country than that
I just want to make sure you know just who
youre gettin under this old hat
Cause girl Im not the kind to twotime or play
games behind your back
Im a little more country than that
Yeah Im sure that youve heard those three
words from others but they fell flat
But this ring aint something that I mean to
give you and then take back
Im a little more country than that
Im a little more country than that
Im a little more country than that
