Well lifes like a road that you travel on
Theres one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind

Theres a world outside every darkened door
Where Blues wont haunt you anymore
For the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore

We wont hesitate
To break down the guarding gate
Theres not much time left today yeay

Life is a highway I wanna ride it
All night long
If youre going my way I wanna drive it
All night long

Through all these cities and all these towns
Its in my blood and its all around
I love now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouvers lights

They knock me down
And back up again
Youre in my blood
Im not a lonely man
Theres no load I cant hold
The roads so rough this I know
Ill be there when the light comes in
Just tell em were survivors

Life is a highway I wanna ride it
All night long
If your going my way I wanna drive it
All night long

Gimme Gimme Gimme Gimme yeah

Life is a highway I wanna ride it
All night long mmmm yeah
If your going my way I wanna drive it
All night long

There was a distance between you and I
between you and I
A misunderstanding once
But now we look it in the eye

OooooYeah

There aint no load that I cant hold
The roads so rough this I know
Ill be there when the light comes in
Just tell em were survivors

Life is a highway I wanna ride it
All night long all night long yeah hey
If your going my way I wanna drive it
All night long

Life is a highway I wanna ride it
All night long
If your going my way I wanna drive it
All night long

Life is a highway I wanna ride it
All night long
If your going my way I wanna drive it
All night long

Gimme Gimme Gimme Gimme yeah
