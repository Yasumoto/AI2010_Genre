You know I like my a chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia pine
And thats home you know
With sweet tea pecan pie and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house its not much to talk about
But its filled with love thats grown in southern ground
And a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
you know I like the sunrise
To see the love in my womans eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mothers love
And its funny how its the little things in life that mean the most
Not where you live what you drive or the price tag on your clothes
Theres no dollar sign on a piece of mind this Ive come to know
So if you agree have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast
To a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
You know I like the sunrise
To see the love in my womans eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mothers love
I thank God for my life
For the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly let it ring
Salute the ones who died
And the ones that gave their lives
So we dont have to sacrifice
All the things we love
Like our chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
You know I like the sunrise
To see the love in my womans eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mothers love
You know I like chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
You know I like the sunrise
To see the love in my womans eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mothers love
