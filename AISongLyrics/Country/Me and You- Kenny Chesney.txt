Ordinary no really dont think so
Not a love this true
Common destiny
We were meant to be
Me and you
Like a perfect scene from a movie screen
Where every dream comes true
Suited perfectly for eternity
Me and you
Every day I need you even more
At the nighttime too
Theres no way
I could ever let you go
Even if I wanted to
Every day I live
I try my best to give
All I have to you
I thank the stars above
That we share this love Me and you
Every day I need you even more
At the nighttime too
Theres no way
I could ever let you go
Even if I wanted to
Ordinary no I really dont think so
Just a precious few
Ever make it last
Get as lucky as
Me and you
Me and you
