Well this town has closed down way too early
And theres nothing to do
So Im driving around in circles
And Im thinking about you
Today I heard you got a new last name
Sure didnt know it was gonna hit me this way
And the radio just keeps on playing all these songs about rain
Now theres all kind of songs about babies and love that goes right
But for some unknown reason nobody wants to play them tonight
Hey I hope its sunny wherever you are
But thats sure not the picture tonight in my car
And it sure aint easing my pain all these songs like
Rainy Night In Georgia
and Kentucky Rain
Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again
Blue Eyes Crying In The early morning Rain
They go on and on
And theres no two the same
Oh it would be easy to blame all these songs about rain
Well I thought I was over you but I guess maybe Im not
Cause when I let you go looks like lonely is all that I got
Guess Ill never know what could have been
Sure aint helping this mood that Im in
If their gonna keep on playing me songs like
Rainy Night In Georgia
and Kentucky Rain
Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again
Blue Eyes Crying In The early morning Rain
They go on and on
And theres no two the same
Oh how I wish I could blame all these songs about rain
All these songs about rain
Songs about rain
