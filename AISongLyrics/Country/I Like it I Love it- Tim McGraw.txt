Spent forty eight dollars last night at the county fair
I throwed out my shoulder but I won her that teddy bear
Shes got me sayin sugar pie honey darlin and dear
I aint seen the Braves play a game all year
Im gonna get fired if I dot get some sleep
My long lost buddies say Im getting in to deep

I like it I love it I want some more of it
I try so hard I cant rise above it
Dont know what it is bout that little gals lovin
But I like it I love it I want some more of it

My Mama and Daddy tried to teach me courtesy
But it never sank in til that girl got a hold of me
Now Im holding umbrellas and opening up doors
Im taking out the trash and Im sweeping my floors
Crossing my fingers counting every kiss
Prayin that it keeps going on like this

I like it I love it I want some more of it
I try so hard I cant rise above it
Dont know what it is bout that little gals lovin
But I like it I love it I want some more of it

Got to wash my truck and dress up
To pick her up to watch TV
And she sits down on the sofa
Shell move a little closer
She cant get enough of me

I like it I love it I want some more of it
I try so hard I cant rise above it
Dont know what it is bout that little gals lovin
But I like it I love it I want some more of it
