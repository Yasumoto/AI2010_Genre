Once upon a lonely time
She swore shed never let you down
You held her tight without a care in mind
While she did her runnin round
At first you wouldnt face the truth
You loved her too much to let go
And though the story had to end
You wanna be her fool again
Friend theres something you should know

Shell have you back
Back to drinkin in no time
Back to walkin on your knees
Boy open up your eyes and see the light
Some things just arent meant to be

I understand how she can get to you
Cause shes made more than one man blind
So try and face the cold hard fact
She would gladly have you back
Back to drinkin in no time

It just dont make no sense to me
To play a game youll never win
You asked me here for my advice
You say she wouldnt break you twice
Friend youd better think again

Shell have you back
Back to drinkin in no time
Back to walkin on your knees
Boy open up your eyes and see the light
Some things just arent meant to be

I understand how she can get to you
Cause shes made more than one man blind
So try and face the cold hard fact
She would gladly have you back
Back to drinkin in no time

So try and face the cold hard fact
She would gladly have you back
Back to drinkin in no time
