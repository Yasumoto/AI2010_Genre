she had a shiny little beemer with the rag top down
sittin in the drive but she wouldnt get out
the dogs were all barkin and waggin around
and i just laughed and said yall get in
she had on a new dress and she curled her hair
she was looking too good not to go somewhere
said what you want to do baby i dont care
we can go to the show we can stay out here
and I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor
we can go slow or make it go faster
down through the woods and out to the pasture
long as im with you it really dont matter
climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
girl you know you got me to hold on to
we can go to town but baby if youd rather
ill take you for a ride on my big green tractor
said we can fire it up and i can show you around
sit up on the hill and watch the sun go down
when the fireflies are dancing and the moon comes out
we can turn on the lights and head back to the house
or we can take another ride on my big green tractor
we can go slow or make it go faster
down through the woods and out to the pasture
long as im with you it really dont matter
climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
girl you know you got me to hold on to
we can go to town but baby if youd rather
ill take you for a ride on my big green tractor
just let me dust off the seat
mmm put your pretty little arms around me
hell yeah
you can climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
girl you know you got me to hold on to
we can go to town but baby if youd rather
ill take you for a ride on my big green tractor
oh yeah yeah
we can go to town
we can go another round
on my big green tractor
