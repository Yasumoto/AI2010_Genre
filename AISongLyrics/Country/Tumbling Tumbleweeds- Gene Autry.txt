Im a roaming cowboy riding all day long
Tumbleweeds around me sing their lonely song
Nights underneath a prairie moon
I ride alone and sing a tune
See them tumbling down
Pledging their love to the ground
Lonely but free Ill be found
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds
Cares of the past are behind
Nowhere to go but Ill find
Just where the trail will wind
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds
I know when night has gone that a new worlds born at dawn
Ill keep rolling along
Deep in my heart is a song
Here on the range I belong
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds
