Id gladly walk across the desert
With no shoes upon my feet
To share with you the last bite
Of bread I had to eat
I would swim out to save you
In your sea of broken dreams
When all your hopes are sinkin
Let me show you what love means

Love can build a bridge
Between your heart and mine
Love can build a bridge
Dont you think its time
Dont you think its time

I would whisper love so loudly
Every heart could understand
That love and only love
Can join the tribes of man
I would give my hearts desire
So that you might see
The first step is to realize
That it all begins with you and me

Love can build a bridge
Between your heart and mine
Love can build a bridge
Dont you think its time
Dont you think its time

When we stand together
Its our finest hour
We can do anything anything
Keep believin in the power

Love can build a bridge
Between your heart and mine
Love can build a bridge
Dont you think its time
Dont you think its time

Love and only love
Love and only love
