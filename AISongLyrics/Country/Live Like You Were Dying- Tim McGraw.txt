He said I was in my early 40s
With a lot of life before me
When a moment came that stopped me on a dime
I spent most of the next days
Looking at the Xrays
And talking bout the options and talking bout sweet time
I asked him when it sank in
That this might really be the real end
Hows it hit ya when you get that kind of news
Man whatd ya do
And he said

I went skydiving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went 27 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu
And I loved deeper
and I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness Ive been denying
And he said Someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin

He said I was finally the husband
That most the time I wasnt
And I became a friend a friend would like to have
And all of a sudden goin fishin
Wasnt such an imposition
And I went three times that year I lost my dad
Well I I finally read the Good Book
And I took a good long hard look
At what Id do if I could do it all again
And then

I went skydiving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fumanchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness Ive been denying
And he said Someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin

Like tomorrow was a gift
And you got eternity to think about whatd you do with it
What did you do with it
What did I do with it
What would I do with it

Skydiving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fumanchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I watched an eagle as it was flying
And he said Someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin
Live like you were dyin
Live like you were dyin
Live like you were dyin
Live like you were dyin
