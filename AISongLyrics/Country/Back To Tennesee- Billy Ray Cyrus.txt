Fancy cars and diamond rings
I seen all kinds of shiny things
I should be feelin like a king
But lord I dont

Great big towns so full of users
Make a million still a loser
Some may bet on you to win
Most hope you wont

Livin wild aint no mercy being free
When it brings you to your knees
Cant keep lying

Ive seen the road now
I know just what I need
To find my way back to Tennessee
Im going home now
To Southern is so sweet
And find my way back to Tennessee

I was only seventeen
I lived behind my beauty queen
I turned my back on everything
And everyone

Rooms with lots of pretty faces
Still dont fill the empty spaces
Wanderin where Amazing Grace is
There is none no

Now I know theres no comfort in this world
God I miss that hometown girl
Want to hold her

Im on the road now
I know just what I need
To find my way back to Tennessee
Im coming home now
To Southern is so sweet
And find my way back to Tennessee

All this time I was chasing after dreams
It was right in front of me
I was lost without her

Im on the road now
I know just what I need
To find my way back to Tennessee
Im coming home now
To Southern is so sweet
And find my way back to you and me
Find my way back to Tennessee
