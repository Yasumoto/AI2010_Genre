When I walk into work im leading with my chest
skull and bones tattoo and a Harley vest
right up till I clock out Im known as Mr Tough
but when I pull in that drive
I see pigtails and them puppy dog eyes
I metamorphasize


into a six foot teddy bear
younguns runnin everywhere
honey do daddy please
huggin and kissin me
more than enough to make any grown man melt
barbie doll bubble bath
wearing mickey mouses hat
saying prayers singing songs
spongebob marathon and on and on
and when they get done with me
oh anyone could see
standin there
is a six foot teddy bear

I won that blue ribbon on a doubledogdare
a HeMan competition down at the county fair
instant hometown hero
but they dont know
all it ever takes
to put me right back in my place
is a little smiley face

and im a six foot teddy bear
younguns runnin every where
honey do daddy please
huggin and kissin me
more than enough to make any grown man melt
barbie doll bubble bath
wearing mickey mouses hat
saying prayers singing songs
spongebob marathon and on and on
and when they get done with me
oh anyone could see
standin there
is a six foot teddy bear

oh another tea party read DrSeuss
yeah tuck em into bed
if the guys down at work only knew
last night they painted my toe nails red

im a six foot teddy bear
younguns runnin every where
huggin and kissin me
honey do daddy please
more than enough to make any grown man melt
barbie doll bubble bath
wearing mickey mouses hat
saying prayers singing songs
spongebob marathon and on and on
and when they get done with me
oh anyone could see
standin there
is a six foot teddy bear
oh im a six foot teddy bear
