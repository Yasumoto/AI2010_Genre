A Salvation Army band played
And the children drank lemonade
And the morning lasted all day
All day
And through an open window came
Like Sinatra in a younger day
Pushing the town away
away

Ah hey ma ma ma
Into the night
Ah hey ma ma ma hey ah
Life in a northern town
Ah hey ma ma ma

They sat on the stoney ground
And he took a cigarette out
And everyone else came down
To listen
He said In winter 1963
It felt like the world would freeze
With John F Kennedy
And the Beatles

Ah hey ma ma ma
Into the night
Ah hey ma ma ma hey ah
Life in a northern town
Ah hey ma ma ma
Ah hey ma ma ma
Into the night
Ah hey ma ma ma hey ah
They shut the factory down
Ah hey ma ma ma

The evening had turned to rain
Watch the water roll down the drain
As we followed him down
To the station
And though he never would wave goodbye
You could see it written in his eyes
As the train rolled out of sight
Byebye

Ah hey ma ma ma
Into the night
Ah ma ma ma hey ah
Life in a northern town
Ah hey ma ma ma
Take it easy on your self
Ah hey ma ma ma
Into the night
Ah hey ma ma ma hey ah
Life in a northern town
Ah hey ma ma ma
Into the night
Ah hey ma ma ma hey ah
Life in a northern town
Ah hey ma ma ma
Into the Night
Ah hey ma ma ma hey ah
Life in a Northern Town
Ah hey ma ma ma
