Theres a house fly swimming in my sweet tea
Hey darlin pass another Kerr jar to me
Butter drippin off a biscuit baby better take a bite
Cantaloupe thumps like its finaly ripe
Box fan on a lawn chair suckin in swamp air
Thats what country is
It aint a rebel flag you bought at the mall
Its a hide away bed in an old horse stall
Two kids gettin caught stealin a Boones farm kiss
It aint a John Deere cap thats never fell in the cotton
Its a Jimmy Rodgers song that was long forgotten
Its homemade peach ice cream on sunburnt lips
Thats what country is
When the sun starts slippin from the delta sky
And the last scarecrow tucks in for the night
Make a fire throw a blanket on the sandy bank
Bout an hour till we feel the first catfish yank
Barefoot cane pole wavin at the riverboats
They when theyre gone take a dip in the moon glow
Thats what country is
It aint a rebel flag you bought at the mall
Its a hide away bed in an old horse stall
Two kids gettin caught stealin a Boones farm kiss
It aint a John Deere cap thats never fell in the cotton
Its a Jimmy Rodgers song that was long forgotten
Its homemade peach ice cream on sunburnt lips
Thats what country is
It aint a jacked up truck thats never seen a pasture
Its cars pulling over for a no cab tractor
Its homemade peach ice cream on sunburnt lips
No it cant be bought its somethin youre born with
Thats what country is
Thats what country is
Thats what country is
Thats what country is
