Lost my job came home mad
Got a hug and kiss and thats too bad
She said I can go to work until you find another job
I thought I like the sound of that
Watch TV and take long naps
Go from a hand working dad to being Mr Mom
Well
Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer
Crayons go up one drawer higher
Rewind Barney for the fifteenth time
Breakfast six naps at nine
Theres bubble gum in the babys hair
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair
Been crazy all day long and its only Monday
Mr Mom
Football soccer and ballet
Squeeze in Scouts and PTA
And theres that shopping list she left
Thats seven pages long
How much smoke can one stove make
The kids wont eat my charcoal cake
Its more than any maid can take
Being Mr Mom
Well
Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer
Crayons go up one drawer higher
Rewind Barney for the sixteenth time
Breakfast six naps at nine
Theres bubble gum in the babys hair
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair
Been crazy all day long and its only Monday
Mr Mom
Before I fall in bed tonight
If the dog didnt eat the classifieds
Im gonna look just one more time
Cause
Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer
Crayons go up one drawer higher
Rewind Barney for the eighteenth time
Breakfast six naps at nine
Theres bubble gum in the babys hair
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair
Been crazy all day long
Oh been crazy all day long and its only Monday
Mr Mom
Balancin checkbooks juggling bills
Thought there was nothing to it
Baby now I know how you feel
What I dont know is how you do it
