Little boy six years old
A little too used to bein alone
Another new mom and dadanother school
Another house thatll never be home
When people ask him how he likes this place
He looks up and says with a smile upon his face

This is my temporary home
Its not where I belong
Windows and rooms that Im passin through
This is just a stop on the way to where Im going
Im not afraid because I know this is my
Temporary Home

Young mom on her own
She needs a little help got nowhere to go
Shes lookin for a job lookin for a way out
Because a halfway house will never be a home
At night she whispers to her baby girl
Someday well find a place here in this world

This is our temporary home
Its not where we belong
Windows and rooms that were passin through
This is just a stop on the way to where were going
Im not afraid because I know this is our
Temporary Home

Old man hospital bed
The room is filled with people he loves
And he whispers dont cry for me
Ill see you all someday
He looks up and says I can see Gods face

This is my temporary Home
Its not where I belong
Windows and rooms that Im passin through
This was just a stopon the way to where Im going
Im not afraid because I know this was
My temporary home

This is our temporary home
