Another long summers come and gone
I dont know why it always ends this way
The boardwalks quiet and the carnival rides
Are empty as my broken heart tonight

But I close my eyes and one more time
Were spinnin around and youre holdin on tightly
The words came out I kissed your mouth
No Fourth of July has ever burned so brightly
You had to go I understand
But you promised youd be back again
And so I wander round this towm
Til summer comes around

I got an old job working at the old park pier
And every summer now for five long years
I grease the gears fix the lights tighten bolts straighten the tracks
And I count the days til you just might come back

But I close my eyes and one more time
Were spinnin around and youre holdin on tightly
The words came out I kissed your mouth
No Fourth of July has ever burned so brightly
You had to go I understand
But you promised youd be back again
And so I wander round this towm
Til summer comes around

Oh and I close my eyes and you and I
Are stuck on the ferris wheel rockin with the motion
Hand in hand we cried and laughed
Knowing that love belonged to us girl
If only for a moment
And Baby Ill be back again
You whispered in my ear
But now the winter wind is the only sound
And everything is closing down
Til summer comes around
