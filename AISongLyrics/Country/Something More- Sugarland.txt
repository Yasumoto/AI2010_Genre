Monday hard to wake up
Fill my coffee cup Im out the door
Yeah the freeways standing still today
Its gonna make me late and thats for sure
Im running out of gas and out of time
Never gonna make it there by nine
Theres gotta be something more
Gotta be more than this
I need a little less hard time
I need a little more bliss
Im gonna take my chances
Taking a chance I might
Find what Im looking for
Theres gotta be something more
Five years and theres no doubt
That Im burnt out Ive had enough
So now boss man heres my two weeks
Ill make it short and sweet so listen up
I could work my life away but why
I got things to do before die
Theres gotta be something more
Gotta be more than this
I need a little less hard time
I need a little more bliss
Im gonna take my chances
Taking a chance I might
Find what Im looking for
Theres gotta be something more
Some believe in destiny and some believe in fate
I believe that happiness is something we create
You best belive that Im not gonna wait
Cause theres gotta be something more
I get home 730 the house is dirt but it can wait
Yeah cause right now I need some downtime
To drink some red wine and celebrate
Armageddon could be knocking at my door
but I aint gonna answer thats for sure
Theres gotta be something more
