Hey girl its me i just called to tell you hi
Call me when you get this
Havent talked lately so hard to find the time
Give the boys a big kiss
Tell them that I miss them
By the way I miss you too
I was thinking just today
About how we used to play
Barbie dolls and makeup
Tea parties dress up
I remember how wed fight
We made up and laughed all night
Wish we were kids again
My sister my friend
Oh yeah before I forget I met someone
I think I really like him
I was wondering if Im jumping the gun
By going out on a limb
And invite him home for Christmas
To meet the family
Seem like just yesterday
You brought home old whats his name
He had been drinking
What were you thinking
After dinner he passed out
We can laugh about it now
Weve learned a lot since then
My sister my friend
Do you think you could come and see me sometime soon
We could just hang out like we used to
Its late and I should go
But I cany hang up the phone
Until I tell you
What I dont tell you enough
Even though at times it seemed
We were more like enemies
Id do it all again
My sister my friend
