I dont wanna spend another lonely night oooh
Ive got the lights turned up
The door is locked the bedroom TVs on
Doing the only thing that gets me through the night
Since youve been gone

Prayin for daylight waiting for that morning sun
So I can act like my whole life aint going wrong
Baby come back to me I swear Ill make it right
Dont make me spend another lonely night
Prayin for daylight
Prayin for daylight

I made a bad miscalculation
Betting you would never leave never leave
Cause if youre getting on with your new life
Then where does that leave me

Prayin for daylight waiting for that morning sun
So I can act like my whole life aint going wrong
Baby come back to me I swear Ill make it right
Dont make me spend another lonely night
Prayin for daylight
Prayin for daylight

Prayin for daylight
Prayin for daylight

Prayin for daylight
Hoping that I didnt wait too long
I didnt wait too long
That this is just the dark before the dawn

Deep in my heart I know
That you love me as much as I love you  you know i love you girl
And that you must be lying somewhere
Looking up to Heaven too

Prayin for daylight waiting for that morning sun
So I can act like my whole life aint going wrong
Baby come back to me I swear Ill make it right
Dont make me spend another lonely night  dont make me speand another lonely night
Prayin for daylight
Prayin for daylight

Prayin for daylight waiting for that morning sun
So I can act like my whole life aint going wrong
Baby come back to me I swear Ill make it right
Dont make me spend another lonely night
Prayin for daylight
Prayin for daylight

Prayin for daylight
I dont want to spend another lonely night
I dont want to spend another lonely night
Prayin for daylight
Prayin for daylight
I dont want to spend another lonely night
Oooo Oooo Oooo Oooo Oooo
Prayin for daylight
