Well I aint never had a problem with California
Theres a lot of good women Sacramento to Corona
But them Hollywood types after a while wear on ya
Strutin around in their size zeros
Skinny little girls no meat on thier bones
Never even heard of George Jones
Aint you glad we aint no California girls
Aint you glad theres still a few of us left who know how to rock your world
Aint afraid to eat fried chicken and dirty dance to Merle
Aint you glad we aint no California girls
There aint nothing wrong with plastic surgery
Well Dolly Parton never looked so good to me
Everybody oughta be exactly who they want to be
But that Paris Hilton gets under my skin
With her big fake smile and her painted on skin
Never had a chance at a real man
Aint you glad we aint no California girls
Aint you glad theres still a few of us left who know how to rock your world
Aint afraid to eat fried chicken and dirty dance to Merle
Aint you glad we aint no California girls
Aint you glad we aint no California girls
Aint you glad theres still a few of us left who know how to rock your world
Aint afraid to eat fried chicken and dirty dance to Merle
Aint you glad we aint no California girls
