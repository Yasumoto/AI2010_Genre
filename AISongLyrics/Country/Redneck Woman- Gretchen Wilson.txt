Well I aint never
been the barbie doll type
no I cant swig that sweet champaigne
Id rather drink beer all night
In a tavern or in a honky tonk
I want a 4 wheel drive tailgate
Ive got posters on my wall of Skynard Kid and Straight
Some people look down on my
But I dont give a rip
I stand barefooted in my own front yard with a baby in on my hip
Cause Im redneck woman
I aint no high class broad
Im just a product of my rasin
And I say hey yall and Yee Haw
And I keep my christmas lights on my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Charle Daniels song
So heres to all my sisters out there keeping it country
Let me get a big Hell Yea from the redneck girls like me
Hell Yeah
Hell Yeah
Victorias Secret
Well thier stuffs real nice
Oh but I can buy the same damn thing on a WalMart shelf half price
And still look sexy
Just as sexy
As those models on tv
No I dont need no designer tag to make my men want me
You might think Im trashy
A little too hard core
But get in my neck of the woods
Im just the girl next door
Hey Im redneck woman
I aint no high class broad
Im just a product of my rasin
And I say hey yall and Yee Haw
And I keep my christmas lights on my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Tanya Tucker song
So heres to all my sisters out there keeping it country
Let me get a big Hell Yea from the redneck girls like me
Hell Yeah
Hell Yeah
Im redneck woman
I aint no high class broad
Im just a product of my rasin
And I say hey yall and Yee Haw
And I keep my christmas lights on my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Ol Bo Seafus song
So heres to all my sisters out there keeping it country
Let me get a big Hell Yea from the redneck girls like me
Hell Yeah
Hell Yeah
Hell Yeah
Hell Yeah
Hell Yeah
Hell Yeah
I Said Hell Yeah
