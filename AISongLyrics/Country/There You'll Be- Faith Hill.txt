When I think back
On these times
And the dreams
We left behind
Ill be glad cause
I was blessed to get
To have you in my life
When I look back
On these days
Ill look and see your face
You were right there for me

In my dreams
Ill always see you soar
Above the sky
In my heart
There always be a place
For you for all my life
Ill keep a part
Of you with me
And everywhere I am
There youll be

Well you showed me
How it feels
To feel the sky
Within my reach
And I always
Will remember all
The strength you
Gave to me
Your love made me
Make it through
Oh I owe so much to you
You were right there for me

In my dreams
Ill always see you soar
Above the sky
In my heart
There always be a place
For you for all my life
Ill keep a part
Of you with me
And everywhere I am
There youll be

Cause I always saw in you
My light my strength
And I want to thank you
Now for all the ways
You were right there for me
You were right there for me
For always

In my dreams
Ill always see you soar
Above the sky
In my heart
There always be a place
For you for all my life
Ill keep a part
Of you with me
And everywhere I am
There youll be
