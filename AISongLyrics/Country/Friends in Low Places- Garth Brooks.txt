Blame it all on my roots
I showed up in boots
And ruined your black tie affair
The last one to know
The last one to show
I was the last one
You thought youd see there
And I saw the surprise
And the fear in his eyes
When I took his glass of champagne
And I toasted you
Said  honey  we may be through
But youll never hear me complain

Cause Ive got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And Ill be okay
Im not big on social graces
Think Ill slip on down to the oasis
Oh  Ive got friends in low places

Well  I guess I was wrong
I just dont belong
But then  Ive been there before
Everythings all right
Ill just say goodnight
And Ill show myself to the door
Hey  I didnt mean
To cause a big scene
Just give me an hour and then
Well  Ill be as high
As that ivory tower
That youre livin in

Cause Ive got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And Ill be okay
Im not big on social graces
Think Ill slip on down to the oasis
Oh  Ive got friends in low places

I guess I was wrong
I just dont belong
But then  Ive been there before
And everything is alright
Ill just say goodnight
And Ill show myself to the door
I didnt mean to cause a big scene
Just wait til I finish this glass
Then sweet little lady
Ill head back to the bar
And you can kiss my ass
