His old man was a rebel yeller that boy to the bone and say cant trust a color feller he
judge em by the tone of their skin He was raised to think like his dad narrow mind full of
hate on the road to no where fast till the grace of god got in the way then he saw the light n
hit hes knees n cried and said a prayer rose up a brand new man n left the old one right
there
Heres to the strong thanks to the brave dont give up hope some people change
against all odds against the gray love finds a way some people change
She was born with her mothers habit guess you can say its in her blood she hates it that
shes gotta have it she fills a glass up n she love to kill that bottle but all she could
think about is a better life a second chance for everyone shes letting down she throws that
bottle down
Heres to the strong thanks to the brave dont give up hope Some people change
against all odds against the gray love finds a way some people change
Thank god for those who make it let them be the light
Some people change
Heres to the strong thanks to the brave dont give up hope Some people change against all
odds against the gray love finds a way some people change
Some people change
Some people change
