I can make anybody pretty
I can make you believe any lie
I can make you pick a fight
with somebody twice
your size
Well Ive been known to cause a few breakups
and Ive been known to cause a few births
I can make you new friends
Or get you fired from work
And since the day I left Milwaukee
Lyncheburg Bourbon France
Been makin the bars
With lots of big money
and helpin white people dance
I got you in trouble in high school
and college now that was a ball
you had some of the best times
youll never remember with me
Alcohol Alcohol
I got blamed at your wedding reception
for your best mans emberrasing speech
and also for those naked pictures of you at the beach
Ive influenced kings and world leaders
I helped Hemingway write like he did
and Ill bet you a drink or two that I can make you
put that lampshade on your head
And since the day I left Milwaukee
Lyncheburg Bourbon France
Been makin a fool out of folks
just like you
and helpin white people dance
I am medicine and I am poison
I can help you up or make you fall
you had some of the best times
youll never remember with me
Alcohol
And since the day I left Milwaukee
Lyncheburg Bourbon France
Been makin the bars
With lots of big money
crowd and helpin white people dance
I got you in trouble in high school
and college now that was a ball
you had some of the best times
youll never remember with me
