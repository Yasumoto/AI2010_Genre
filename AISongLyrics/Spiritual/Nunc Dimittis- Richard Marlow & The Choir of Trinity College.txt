Lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace
According to thy word
For mine eyes have seen thy salvation
Which thou hast prepared before the face
Of thy people Israel
To be a light to lighten the Gentiles
And to be the glory of thy people Israel
Glory be to the Father
And to the Son and to the Holy Ghost
As it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be
World without end Amen
