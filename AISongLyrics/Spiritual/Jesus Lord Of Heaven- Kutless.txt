Jesus Lord of Heaven
I did not deserve
the grace that You have given
and the promise of Your word
Lord I stand in wonder
of the sacrifice You made
with mercy beyond measure
My debt You freely paid
Your love is deeper than the oceans
higher than the heavens
reaches beyond the stars in the sky
Jesus Your love has no bound
