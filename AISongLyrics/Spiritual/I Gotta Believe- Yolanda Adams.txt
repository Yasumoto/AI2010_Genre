Ooh Ooh Talk about it
You know life has its ups and downs
itCan Turn your pretty face to an ugly frown
Seems that when I face one thing another one comes
Clouding up my vision but I can feel the sun
I believe that I can do this I know that I can win
Just as long as I have his love within
I believe that I can make it I can make it through the night
I believe that I can walk on with my head held high
I believe that I am special in every way
But in order to have my victoryI gotta believeOoh yeah
I have to see myself at the finish line
I have to visualize that everything will fall in line
I have to visualize the land while riding through the storm
I have to trust in my father and open up my heart
I know that I can do this I know that I can win
Just as long as I have his love within
I believeOhh oohh
I believe I can walk on with my head held high
I believe that I am special yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
But in order to have my victory
Ohh Heartbreak I can handle it
And heart pain I can handle it
Being let down I can handle it
No ones around I can handle it
I believe I can I can handle it
I receive I can I can handle it
And now Im walking right into my victory
I believe that I can
I believe Ill walk on walk on walk on walk on
I am special yes I am Oh oh oho ho
And in order to have victory Everybody help me say

I believe that there no body like me
And in order for me to victory I gotta believe yeah
