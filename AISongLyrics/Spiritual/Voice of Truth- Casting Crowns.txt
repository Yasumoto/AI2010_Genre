Oh what I would do to have
the kind of faith it takes
To climb out of this boat Im in
Onto the crashing waves
To step out of my comfort zone
Into the realm of the unknown
Where Jesus is
And hes holding out his hand

But the waves are calling out my name
and they laugh at me
Reminding me of all the times
Ive tried before and failed
The waves they keep on telling me
time and time again
Boy youll never win
You youll never win

But the Voice of truth tells me a different story
the Voice of truth says do not be afraid
and the Voice of truth says this is for My glory
Out of all the voices calling out to me
I will choose to listen and believe the Voice of truth

Oh what I would do
to have the kind of strength it takes
To stand before a giant
with just a sling and a stone
Surrounded by the sound
of a thousand warriors
shaking in their armor
Wishing theyd have had the strength to stand

But the giants calling out
my name and he laughs at me
Reminding me of all the times
Ive tried before and failed
The giant keeps on telling me
time and time again
Boy youll never win
youll never win

But the voice of truth tells me a different story
the Voice of truth says do not be afraid
and the Voice of truth says this is for My glory
Out of all the voices calling out to me
I will choose to listen and believe the Voice of truth

But the stone was just the right size
to put the giant on the ground
and the waves they dont seem so high
from on top of them looking down
I will soar with the wings of eagles
when I stop and listen to the sound of Jesus
singing over me

But the Voice of truth tells me a different story
The Voice of truth says do not be afraid
And the Voice of truth says this is for my glory
Out of all the voices calling out to me calling out to me
I will choose to listen and believe I will choose to listen and believe
I will choose to listen and believe the Voice of truth

I will listen and believe
I will listen and believe the Voice of truth
I will listen and believe
Cause Jesus you are the Voice of truth
And I will listen to you oh you are the Voice of truth
