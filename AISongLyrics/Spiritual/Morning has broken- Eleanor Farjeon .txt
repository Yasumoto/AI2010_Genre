Morning has broken
Like the first morning
Black bird has spoken
Like the first bird
Praise the singing
Praise for the morning
Praise for them springing
Fresh from the Word
Sweet the rains new fall
Sunlit from heaven
Like the first dewfall
On the first grass
Praise for the sweetness
Of the wet garden
Sprung in completeness
Where His feet pass
Mine is the sunlight
Mine is the morning
Born of the one light
Eden saw play
Praise with elation
Praise evry morning
Gods recreation
Of the newday
