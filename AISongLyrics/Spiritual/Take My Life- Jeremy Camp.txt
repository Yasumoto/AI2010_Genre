here i am before you now
like a child im reaching out
here i am im giving all i can
breaking my pride i feel im through
shattered inside i run to you
and now i give it all to you
take my life take my mind
take my soul take my will
i am yours now and i give it all to you
laying all down before my king
offering all my everthing
laying all down before the one i serve
i can understand the reasons why
you came on this earth and died
and now i give it all to you
i can feel you on my shoulder
so i know that you are there
i can see you paint my picture
the beauty is all there
