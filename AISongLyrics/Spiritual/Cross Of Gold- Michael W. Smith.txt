Where do you stand
What is your statement
What is it youre trying to say
Whats in your hand
Whats in your basement
Whats in the cards you dont play
Are you holding the key
Or are you intending
To pick the lock of heavens gate
Its confusing to me
The message youre sending
And I dont know if I can relate

Whats you line
Tell me why you wear your cross of gold
State of mind
Or does it find a way into your soul

Is it a flame
Is it a passion
A symbol of love living in you
Or is it a game
Religion in fashion
Some kind of phase youre going through
We all travel the extremes
From cellar to rafter
Looking for a place in the sun
So Im trying to see
What youre headed after
But I dont know where youre coming from

Whats you line
Tell me why you wear your cross of gold
State of mind
Or does it find a way into your soul

For some its simply something to wear around your neck
Just a chain
Jewelry
Is it decoration
Is it an icon
Or proclamation
An icon of what
What
For some its simply something to wear around your neck
Just a chain
It means a lot more than that to me

Whats you line
Tell me why you wear your cross of gold
State of mind
Or does it find a way into your soul
