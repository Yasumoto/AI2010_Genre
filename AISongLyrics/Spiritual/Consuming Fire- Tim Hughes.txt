there must be more than this
o breath of god come breath within
there must be more than this
spirit of god we wait for you
fill us anew we pray
fill us anew we pray
consuming fire
fan into flame
a passion for your name
spirit of god
fall in this place
lord have Your way
lord have Your way
with us
come like a rushing wind
clothe us with power from on high
now set the captives free
leave us abandoned to Your praise
lord let Your glory fall
lord let Your glory fall
consuming fire
fan into flame
a passion for Your name
spirit of god
fall in this place
lord have Your way
lord have Your way
with us
