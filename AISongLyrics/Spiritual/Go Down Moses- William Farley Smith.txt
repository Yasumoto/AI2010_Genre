When Israel was in Egypts land
let my people go
oppressed so hard they could not stand
let my people go
Go down go down Moses Moses
way down in Egypts land
tell old Pharaoh
to let my people go
Thus saith the Lord bold Moses said
let my people go
if not Ill smite your firstborn dead 	let my people go
No more shall they in bondage toil
let my people go
let them come out with Egypts spoil
let my people go
We need not always weep and mourn
let my people go
and wear those slavery chains forlorn
let my people go
Come Moses you will not get lost
let my people go
stretch out your rod and come across
let my people go
As Israel stood by the waters side
let my people go
at Gods command it did divide
let my people go
When they had reached the other shore
let my people go
they sang a song of triumph oer
let my people go
O Moses the cloud shall cleave the way
let my people go
a fire by night a shade by day
let my people go
Your foes shall not before you stand
let my people go
and youll possess fair Canaans land
let my people go
This worlds a wilderness of woe
let my people go
O let us on to Canaan go
let my people go
O let us all from bondage flee
let my people go
and let us all in Christ be free
let my people go
