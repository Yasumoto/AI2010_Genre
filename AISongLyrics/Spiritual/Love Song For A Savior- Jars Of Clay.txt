In open fields of wild flowers
She breathes the air flies away
She thanks her Jesus for the daisies and the roses
In no simple language
Someday shell understand the meaning of it all

Hes more than the laughter
Or the stars in the heavens
As close as a heartbeat
Or a song on her lips
Someday shell trust him
And learn how to see him
Someday hell call her
And she will come running
Fall in his arms the tears will fall down
And shell pray

I want to fall in love with you

Sitting silent wearing sunday best
The sermon echoes through the walls
A great salvation through it
Goes to the people who stare into nowhere
Cant feel the chains on their souls

Hes more than the laughter
Or the stars in the heavens
As close as a heartbeat
Or a song on her lips
Someday well trust him
And learn how to see him
Someday hell call us
And we will come running
Fall in his arms
The tears will fall down and well pray

I want to fall in love with you

Seems to easy to call you savior
Not close enough to call you a god
So as I sit and think of
Words I can mention to show my devotion

I want to fall in love with you
