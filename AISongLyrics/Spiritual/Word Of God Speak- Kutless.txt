Im finding myself at a loss for words
And the funny thing is its okay
The last thing I need is to be heard
But to hear what You would say

Word of God speak
Would You pour down like rain
Washing my eyes to see
Your majesty
To be still and know
That Youre in this place
Please let me stay and rest
In Your holiness
Word of God speak

Im finding myself in the midst of You
Beyond the music beyond the noise
All that I need is to be with You
And in the quiet hear Your voice

Word of God speak
Would You pour down like rain
Washing my eyes to see
Your majesty
To be still and know
That Youre in this place
Please let me stay and rest
In Your holiness
Word of God speak

Word of God speak
Would You pour down like rain
Washing my eyes to see
Your majesty
To be still and know
That Youre in this place
Please let me stay and rest
In Your holiness
Word of God speak

Im finding myself at a loss for words
And the funny thing is its okay
