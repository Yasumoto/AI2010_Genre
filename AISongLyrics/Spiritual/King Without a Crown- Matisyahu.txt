Whats this feeling
My love will rip a hole in the ceiling
Givin myself to you from the essence of my being
Sing to my God all these songs of love and healing
Want Mashiach now so its time we start revealing

Youre all that I have and youre all that I need
Each and every day I pray to get to know you please
I want to be close to you  yes Im so hungry
Youre like water for my soul when it gets thirsty
Without you theres no me
Youre the air that I breathe
Sometimes the world is dark and I just cant see
With these  demons surround all around to bring me down to negativity
But I believe  yes I believe  I said I believe
Ill stand on my own two feet
Wont be brought down on one knee
Fight with all of my might and get these demons to flee
Hashems rays fire blaze burn bright and I believe
Out of darkness comes light  twilight unto the heights
Crown Heights burnin up all through the twilight
Said  thank you to my God  now I finally got it right
And Ill fight with all of my heart  and all a my soul  and all a my might


Me no want no sinsemilla
That would only bring me down
Burn away my brain no way my brain is to compound
Elevated my soul youre a flying my sound
Like the sun of a sun ray burning up through a cloud
Torah food for my brain let it rain till I drown
Thunder
Let the blessings come down

Strip away the layers and reveal your soul
Got to give yourself up and then you become whole
Youre a slave to yourself and you dont even know
You want to live the fast life but your brain moves slow
If youre trying to stay high then youre bound to stay low
You want God but you cant deflate your ego
If youre already there then theres nowhere to go
If youre cups already full then its bound to overflow
If youre drowning in the waters and you cant stay afloat
Ask Hashem for mercy and hell throw you a rope
Youre looking for help from God you say he couldnt be found
Looking up to the sky and searchin beneath the ground
Like a King without his Crown
Yes  I wanna get down
A King without his Crown
Yes  you keep fallin down
You really want to live but cant get rid of your frown
Tried to reach unto the heights and wound bound down on the ground
Given up your pride and the you heard a sound
Out of night comes day and out of day comes light
Nullified to the One like sunlight in a ray
Makin room for his love and a fire gone blaze


Reelin him in
Where ya been
Where ya been
Where ya been for so long
Its hard to stay strong been livin in galus for 2000 years strong
Where ya been for so long
Been livin in this exile for too long
