Who are we that You would be mindful of us
What do You see thats worth looking our way
We are free in ways that we never should be
Sweet release from the grip of these chains
Like hinges straining from the weight my heart no longer can keep from singing
All that is within me cries
For You alone be glorified Emmanuel God with us
My heart sings a brand new song
The debt is paid these chains are gone
Emmanuel God with us
Lord You know our hearts dont deserve Your glory
Still You show a love we cannot afford
Like hinges straining from the weight my heart no longer can keep from singing
All that is within me cries
For You alone be glorified Emmanuel God with us
My heart sings a brand new song
The debt is paid these chains are gone
Emmanuel God with us
Such a tiny offering compared to Calvary nevertheless we lay it at your feet
Such a tiny offering compared to Calvary nevertheless we lay this at your feet
All that is within me cries
For You alone be glorified Emmanuel God with us
My heart sings a brand new song
My debt is paid these chains are gone
Emmanuel God with us
