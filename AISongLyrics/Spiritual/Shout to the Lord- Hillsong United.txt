My Jesus My Savior
Lord there is none like You
All of my days
I want to praise
The wonders of Your mighty love
My Comfort My Shelter
Tower of refuge and strength
Let every breath
And all that I am
Never cease to worship You
Shout to the Lord
All the earth
Let us sing
Power and majesty
Praise to the King
Mountains bow down
And the seas will roar
At the sound of Your Name
I sing for joy at the work of Your hands
Forever Ill love you
Forever Ill stand
Nothing compares to the promise I have in You
