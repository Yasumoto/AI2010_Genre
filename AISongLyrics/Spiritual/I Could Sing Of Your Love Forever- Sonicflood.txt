Over the mountains and the sea
Your river runs with love for me
And I will open up my heart
And let the healer set me free
Im happy to be in the truth
And I will daily lift my hands
For I will always sing
Of when your love came down

I could sing of your love forever
I could sing of your love forever
I could sing of your love forever
I could sing of your love forever

Over the mountains and the sea
Your river runs with love for me
And I will open up my heart
And let the healer set me free
Im happy to be in the truth
And I will daily lift my hands
For I will always sing
Of when your love came down

I could sing of your love forever
I could sing of your love forever
I could sing of your love forever
I could sing of your love forever

Oh I feel like dancing
This foolishness I know
But when the world has seen the light
They will dance with joy
Like were dancing now

I could sing of your love forever
I could sing of your love forever
I could sing of your love forever
I could sing of your love forever
