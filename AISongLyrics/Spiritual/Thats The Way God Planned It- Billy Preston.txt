Why cant we be humble
Like the good lord say
He promised to exault us
But no one is away
How men be so greedy
When theres so much left
All things are God given
And they all have been blessed
Thats the way God planned it
Thats the way God wants it to be be
Thats the way God planned it
Thats the way God wants it to be be
Let not your heart be troubled
Let mourning sobbing cease
Learn to help one another
And live in perfect peace
If wed just be humbler
Like the good lord say
He promised to exault us
But love is the way
Thats the way God planned it
Thats the way God wants it to be be
You better believe me
Thats the way God planned it
Thats the way God wants it to be be
I hope you get this message
Where you wont others will
You dont understand me
But Ill love you still
Thats the way God planned it
Thats the way God wants it to be be
