Icy chills round your heart
A heart thats made of stone
It seems like
Life is out to get you
To destroy what you want
I know that that you blame me for all that you go through
It could be so different if you would just let it go

Youre all alone
Running out of ways to
Hold on to hope
And it always slips away
Youre all alone
But you dont have to
Pretend to cope
There is a brighter way

If you would change your perspective
Youd see that it is true
Life is not always what you want
Sometimes its hard to bear
Id be with you and help you in all that you go through
I love you let Me change your heart by coming in

Youre all alone
Running out of ways to
Hold on to hope
And it always slips away
Youre all alone
But you dont have to
Pretend to cope
There is a brighter way
