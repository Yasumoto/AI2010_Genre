there are many prodigal sons
on our city streets they run
searching for shelter
there are homes broken down
peoples hopes have fallen to the ground
from failures
this is an emergency
there are tears from the saints
for the lost and unsaved
were crying for them come back home
were crying for them come back home
and all your children will stretch out their hands
and pick up the crippled man
father we will lead them home
father we will lead them home
there are schools full of hatred
even churches have forsaken
love and mercy
may we see this generation
in its state of desperation
for your glory
this is an emergency
sinner reach out your hands
children in christ you stand
sinner reach out your hands
children in christ you stand
and all Your children will stretch out their hands
and pick up the crippled man
father we will lead them home
father we will lead them home
