Do you feel the tensions rise
Do you know why we always fight
To be better better than you
And you better than me

I am not what you see oh no
Not much more than a slave I wish to be
I am not what you see
Not much more a slave I should be
Nothing more a slave I will be

How could I ever think to be more
than the one who created me
I watched him do all that he said his words were
Be a servant to all

I am not what you see oh no
Not much more than a slave I wish to be
I am not what you see
Not much more a slave I should be
Nothing more a slave I will be

Only one deserves this exaltation
Only one deserves this elevation
But even He He laid it down to serve on bended knee

I am not what you see oh no
Not much more than a slave I wish to be
I am not what you see
Not much more a slave I should be
Nothing more a slave I will be
