I have read about the days of old
About the men who followed You
And how they saw the supernatural
And became the chosen few

So I come before You now
Tearing off my earthly crowns
For this one thing I have found

I want a faith like that
To see the dead rise or to see You pass by oh I
I want a faith like that
Whatever the cost Ill suffer the loss oh I
I want a faith like that

Im not looking for a miracle
Signs and wonders or things thereof

I caught a glimpse of what You want for me
And what I have is not enough

I read the story one more time
Of those who gave to You their lives
With no fear or compromise

I want a faith like that
To see the dead rise or to see You pass by oh I
I want a faith like that
Whatever the cost Ill suffer the loss oh I
I want a faith like that

I want a faith that can move any mountain
And send them to the seas
I want a faith that can break every stronghold
That keeps You that keeps from me

And I want a faith like that
To see the dead rise or to see You pass by oh I

I want a faith like that
To see the dead rise or to see You pass by oh I
I want a faith like that
Whatever the cost Ill suffer the loss oh I
I want a faith like that

I want a faith like that
A faith like that
