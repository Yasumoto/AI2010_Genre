Who is this King of Glory that pursues me with his love
And haunts me with each hearing of His softly spoken words
My conscience a reminder of forgiveness that I need
Who is this King of Glory who offers it to me

Who is this King of angels O blessed Prince of Peace
Revealing things of Heaven and all its mysteries
My spirits ever longing for His grace in which to stand
Whos this King of glory Son of God and son of man

His name is Jesus precious Jesus
The Lord Almighty the King of my heart
The King of glory

Who is this King of Glory with strength and majesty
And wisdom beyond measure the gracious King of kings
the Lord of Earth and Heaven the Creator of all things
Who is this King of Glory Hes everything to me

The Lord of Earth and Heaven the Creator of all things
He is the King of glory Hes everything to me
