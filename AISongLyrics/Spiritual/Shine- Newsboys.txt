dull as dirt
you cant assert the kind of light
that might persuade
a strict dictator to retire
fire the army
teach the poor origami
the truth is in
the proof is when
you hear your heart start asking
Whats my motivation


and try as you may there isnt a way
to explain the kind of change
that would make an Eskimo renounce fur
that would make a vegetarian barbecue hamster
unless you can trace this aboutface
to a certain sign

shine
make em wonder what youve got
make em wish that they were not
on the outside looking bored
shine
let it shine before all men
letem see good works and then
let em glorify the Lord

out of the shaker and onto the plate
it isnt Karma
it sure aint fate
that would make a Deadhead sell his van
that would make a schizophrenic turn in his crayons
Oprah freaks
and science seeks a rationale
that shall excuse
this strange behavior

when you let it shine
you will inspire
the kind of entire turnaround
that would make a bouncer take ballet
even bouncers who arent happy
but out of the glare
with nowhere to turn
you aint gonna learn it on Whats My Line

shine
make em wonder what youve got
make em wish that they were not
on the outside looking bored
shine
let it shine before all men
letem see good works and then
let em glorify the Lord

make em wish that they were not
