Thought that I was all alone broken and afraid
But You were there with me
Yes You were there with me

And I didnt even know that I had lost my way
But You were there with me
Yes You were there with me

Til You opened my eyes Id never know
That I couldnt ever make it without You

Even though the journeys long
And I know the road is hard
Well the One whos gone before me
He will help me carry on
After all that Ive been through now I realize the truth
That I must go through the valley to stand upon the mountain of God

As I travel on the road that You have lead me down
You are here with me
Yes You are here with me
I have need for nothing more
Oh now that I have found that You are here with me
Yes You are here with me

I confess from time to time I lose my way
But You are always there to bring me back again

Sometimes I think of where it is Ive come from
And the things Ive left behind
But of all Ive had what I possessed
Nothing can quite compare with whats in front of me
With whats in front of me
