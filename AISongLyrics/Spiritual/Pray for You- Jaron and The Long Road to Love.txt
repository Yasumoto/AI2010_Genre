I havent been to church since I dont remember when Things were goin great til they fell apart again So I listened to the preacher as he told me what to do He said you cant go hatin others who have done wrong to you Sometimes we get angry but we must not condemn Let the good Lord do His job and you just pray for them I pray your brakes go out runnin down a hill I pray a flowerpot falls from a window sill and knocks you in the head like Id like to I pray your birthday comes and nobody calls I pray youre flyin high when your engine stalls I pray all your dreams never come true Just know whereever you are honey I pray for you Im really glad I found my way to church Cause Im already feelin better and I thank God for the words Yeah Im goin take the high road And do what the preacher told me to do You keep messin up and Ill keep prayin for you I pray your tire blows out at 110 I pray you pass out drunk with your best friend and wake up with his and her tattoos I pray your brakes go out runnin down a hill I pray a flowerpot falls from a window sill and knocks you in the head like Id like to I pray your birthday comes and nobody calls I pray youre flyin high when your engine stalls I pray all your dreams never come true Just know whereever you are near or far in your house or in your car wherever you are honey I pray for youI pray for you
