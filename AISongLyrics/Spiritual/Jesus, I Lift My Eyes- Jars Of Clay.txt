When sins and fears prevailing rise
And fainting hope almost expires
Jesus to Thee I lift my eyes
To Thee I breathe my souls desires
Are you not mine my living Lord
And can my hope my comfort die
Fixed on the everlasting word
That word which built the earth and sky

Jesus I lift my eyes
To Thee I breathe my souls desires
Jesus I lift my eyes
To Thee I lift my eyes

Here let my faith unshaken dwell
Immovable the promise stands
Not all the powers of earth or hell
Can ere dissolve the sacred bands

Jesus I lift my eyes
To Thee I breathe my souls desires
Jesus I lift my eyes
To Thee I lift my eyes

Here oh my soul
Thy trust repose
If Jesus is forever mine
Not death itself that last of foes
Can break a union so divine

Jesus I lift my eyes
To Thee I breathe my souls desires
Jesus I lift my eyes
To Thee I breathe my souls desires
