Over the mountains and the sea
Your river runs with the love for me
and I will open up my heart
and let the healer set me free
Im happy to be in the truth
and I will daily lift my hands
for I will always sing of when Your love came down
I could sing of your love forever
Over the mountains and the sea
Your river runs with the love for me
and I will open up my heart
and let the healer set me free
Im happy to be in the truth
and I will daily lift my hands
for I will always sing of when Your love came down
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
Oh I feel like dancin
Its foolishness I know
But when the world has seen the light
They will dance with joy
Like were dancing now
I could sing of Your love forever
oh I could sing of love
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing I could sing
I could sing of Your love forever
Just to sing the praises of you Lord
I could sing of Your love forever
I will sing of Your love forever
I could sing
I will sing of Your love forever
I lift my hands and praise His holy name
I will sing of Your love forever
Love forever
I could sing of Your love
oh sing and sing and sing and sing to you
I will sing
Oh Oh Oh
People I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
