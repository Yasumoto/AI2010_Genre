Give to the wind your fear
Hope and be undismayed
God hears your sighs and counts your tears
God will lift up
God will lift up
Lift up your head

God will lift up your head
God will lift up your head
God will lift up your head
He will lift up lift up your head

Leave to His sovereign way
To choose and to command
Then shall we wandering on His way
Know how wise and how strong
How wise and how strong

God will lift up your head
God will lift up your head
God will lift up your head
He will lift up lift up your head

Through waves and clouds and storms
He gently clears the way
Wait because in His time so shall this night
Soon end in joy
Soon end in joy
Soon end in joy
Soon end in joy

God will lift up your head
God will lift up your head
God will lift up your head
He will lift up lift up your head
