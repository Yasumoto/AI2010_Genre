Everyone needs compassion
Love thats never failing
Let mercy fall on me

Everyone needs forgiveness
The kindness of a Savior
The Hope of nations

Savior He can move the mountains
My God is Mighty to save
He is Mighty to save

Forever Author of salvation
He rose and conquered the grave
Jesus conquered the grave

So take me as You find me
All my fears and failures
Fill my life again

I give my life to follow
Everything I believe in
Now I surrender

My Savior He can move the mountains
My God is Mighty to save
He is Mighty to save
Forever Author of salvation
He rose and conquered the grave
Jesus conquered the grave

Shine your light and let the whole world see
Were singing for the glory of the risen King Jesus

My Savior He can move the mountains
My God is Mighty to save
He is Mighty to save
Forever Author of salvation
He rose and conquered the grave
Jesus conquered the grave

My Savior you can move the mountains
You are mighty to save
You are mighty to save
Forever Author of Salvation
You rose and conquered the grave
Yes you conquered the grave
