Give me something that I can believe
And then Ill share it with the world for everyone to see
Take away the darkness all the pain and sadness
I know its you that put this light inside of me

I believe in a faith thats strong
I believe in a hope that carries on
I believe in these things and more
Most of all most of all
I believe in love

If I had the strength to move a mountain
Would you be amazed by all of my abilities
I guess it would not mean much if I didnt have love
And this is what I really want you all to see
