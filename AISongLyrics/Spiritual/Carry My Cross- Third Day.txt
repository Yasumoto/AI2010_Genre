As long as I remember
Ive been walking through the wilderness
Praying to the Father and waiting for My time
Ive come here with a mission
And soon Ill give My life for this world

Im praying in the garden and Im looking for a miracle
I find the journey hard but it was the reason I was born
Can this cup be passed on
Lord I pray Your will be done in this world

So I carry My cross and Ill carry the shame
To the end of the road
Through the struggle and pain and Ill do it for love
No it wont be in vain
Yes Ill carry My cross
And Ill carry the shame

I feel like Im alone here and Im treated like a criminal
The time has come for me now even though Ive done no wrong
Father please forgive them they know not what theyve done in this world

Three more days and Ill be coming back again
There more days and Ill be coming back again
