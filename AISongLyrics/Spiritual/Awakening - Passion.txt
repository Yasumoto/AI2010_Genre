In our hearts Lord In this nation Awakening
Holy Spirit we desire awakening

For You and You alone
Awake my soul Awake my soul and sing
For the world you love
Your will be done Let Your will be done in me

In Your presence In Your power awaken me
For this moment For this hour awaken me

For You and You alone
Awake my soul Awake my soul and sing
For the world You love
Your will be done Let Your will be done in me

For You and You alone
Awake my soul awake my soul and sing
For the world You love
Your will be done Let Your will be done in me


Like the rising sun that shines
From the darkness comes a light
I hear Your voice and this is my awakening

Like the rising sun that shines
From the darkness comes a light
I hear Your voice and this is my awakening

Like the rising sun that shines
Awake my soul Awake my soul and sing
From the darkness comes a light
Awake my soul Awake my soul and sing
Like the rising sun that shines
Awake my soul Awake my soul and sing
Only You can raise a life
Awake my soul Awake my soul sing

In our hearts Lord In the nations Awakening
