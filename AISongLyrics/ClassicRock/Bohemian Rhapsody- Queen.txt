Is this the real life
Is this just fantasy
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
Im just a poor boy
I need no sympathy
Because Im easy come easy go
Little high little low
Any way the wind blows
Doesnt really matter to me to me
Mama just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger now hes dead
Mama life had just begun
But now Ive gone and thrown it all away
Mama oh
Didnt mean to make you cry
If Im not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on carry on as if nothing really matters
Too late my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Bodys aching all the time
Goodbye everybody
Ive got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama oh Anyway the wind blows
I dont want to die
Sometimes wish Id never been born at all
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouch Scaramouch will you do the Fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me
Galileo Galileo Galileo Galileo Galileo Figaro
Magnifico
Im just a poor boy nobody loves me
Hes just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go will you let me go
Bismillah No we will not let you go
Let him go
Bismillah We will not let you go
Let him go
Bismillah We will not let you go
Let me go Will not let you go
Let me go Will not let you go Never never never never
Let me go
No no no no no no no
Oh mama mia mama mia Mama Mia let me go
Beelzebub has the devil put aside for me for me for me
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby cant do this to me baby
Just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here
Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows
