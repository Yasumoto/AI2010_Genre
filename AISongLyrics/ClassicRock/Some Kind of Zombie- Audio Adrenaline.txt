I must have been confused or vain
To let this evil in my brain
Lord did I enjoy the change
That You made inside my heart

Oh here they come
But Im not afraid
Theres no temptation
I cant evade

Stand up straight
I look through the haze
I begin to walk through the maze
Here they come
Theyre all up on me
But Im dead to sin like
Some kind of zombie

I hear you speak and I obey
Some kind of zombie
I walked away from the grave
Some kind of zombie
I will never be afraid
Some kind of zombie
I gave my life away

Im obliged and obey
Im enslaved to what you say

Oh here they come
But Im not afraid
Theres no temptation
I cant evade

Stand up straight
I look through the haze
I begin to walk through the maze
Here they come
Theyre all up on me
But Im dead to sin like
Some kind of zombie

I hear you speak and I obey
Some kind of zombie
I walked away from the grave
Some kind of zombie
I will never be afraid
Some kind of zombie
I gave my life away

Stand up straight
I look through the haze
I begin to walk through the maze
Here they come
Theyre all up on me
But Im dead to sin like
Some kind of zombie

I hear you speak and I obey
Some kind of zombie
I walked away from the grave
Some kind of zombie
I will never be afraid
Some kind of zombie
I gave my life away

Some kind of zombie
I will never be afraid
Some kind of zombie
I will never be afraid
Some kind of zombie
I will never be afraid
