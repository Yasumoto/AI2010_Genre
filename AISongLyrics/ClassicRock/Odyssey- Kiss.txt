From a far off galaxy I hear you calling me
we are on an odyssey
Through the realms of time and space
In that enchanted place
You and I come face to face
Once upon not yet long ago someday
Countless times weve met met along the way
Through the luminescent night
On beams of neon light
You and I in wingged flight
As we cross the starry sea powered by what we see
Now and then the victory
Theres a child in a sundress
Looking at a rainy sky
Theres a place in the desert
Where an ocean once danced by
Theres a song in the silence
Weaving in and out of time
We are notes in the music
Searching for remembered rhyme
On a mountain high somewhere
Where only heroes dare
Stand the stallion and the mare
We have been and we shall be each others destiny
One anothers odyssey
Weve met along the way
Weve met along the way
