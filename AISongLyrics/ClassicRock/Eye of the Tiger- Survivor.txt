Risin up back on the street
Did my time took my chances
Went the distance now Im back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive
So many times it happens too fast
You trade your passion for glory
Dont lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive
Its the Eye of the Tiger
Its the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And hes watching us all
With the Eye of the Tiger
Face to face out in the heat
Hangin tough stayin hungry
They stack the odds till we take to the street
For we kill with the skill to survive
Its the Eye of the Tiger
Its the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And hes watching us all
With the Eye of the Tiger
Risin up straight to the top
Had the guts got the glory
Went the distance now Im not gonna stop
Just a man and his will to survive
Its the Eye of the Tiger
Its the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And hes watching us all
With the Eye of the Tiger
The Eye of the Tiger
The Eye of the Tiger
The Eye of the Tiger
The Eye of the Tiger
