Were leaving together
But still its farewell
And maybe well come back
To earth who can tell
I guess there is no one to blame
Were leaving ground
Will things ever be the same again

Its the final countdown
The final countdown

Ohh
Were heading for Venus and still we stand tall
Cause maybe theyve seen us and welcome us all yea
With so many light years to go and things to be found
To be found
Im sure that well all miss her so

Its the final countdown
The final countdown
The final countdown
The final countdown
Ohh ho ohh

The final countdown oh ho
Its the final countdown
The final countdown
The final countdown
The final countdown

Ohh
Its the final countdown
Were leaving together
The final countdown
Well all miss her so
Its the final countdown
The final countdown
Ohh its the final countdown
Yea
