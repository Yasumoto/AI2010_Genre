I couldnt say where shes coming from
But I just met a lady named DinahMoe Humm

She stroll on over say look here bum
I got a forty dollar bill say you cant make me cum
Yjes cant do it

She made a bet with her sister whos a little bit dumb
She could prove it any time all men was scum

I dont mind that she called me a bum
But I knew right away she was really gonna cum
So I got down to it

I whipped off her bloomersn stiffened my thumb
An applied rotation on her sugar plum

I poked n stroked till my wrist got numb
But I still didnt hear no DinahMoe Humm
DinahMoe Humm

DinahMoe Humm
DinahMoe Humm
Wheres this DinahMoe
Comin from
I done spent three hours
An I aint got a crumb
From the DinahMoe DinahMoe DinahMoe
From the DinahMoe Humm

Got a spot that gets me hot ow
An you aint been to it
No no no no
Got a spot that gets me hot ow
An you aint been to it
No no no
Got a spot that gets me hot
But you aint been to it
No no no no no
Got a spot that gets me hot
But you aint been to it
Cause I cant get into it
Unless I get out of it
An I gotta get out of it
Before I get into it
Cause I never get into it
Unless I get out of it
An I gotta be out of it
To get myself into it

She looked over at me with a glazed eye
And some bovine perspiration on her upper lip area
And she said

Just get me wasted
An youre halfway there
Cause if my minds tore up
Then my body dont care

I rubbed my chinnychinchin
An said mymymy
What sort of thing
Might this lady get high upon

I checked out her sister
Who was holdin the bet
An wondered what kind of trip
The young lady was on

The forty dollar bill didnt matter no more
When her sister got nekkid an laid on the floor
She said DinahMoe might win the bet
But she could use a little ______ if I wasnt done yet

I told her
Just because the sun
Want a place in the sky
No reason to assume
I wouldnt give her a try

So I pulled on her hair
Got her legs in the air
An asked if she had any cooties on there

Whaddya mean cooties No cooties on me

She was bunsup kneelin
BUNS UP
I was wheelin an dealin
WHEELIN AN DEALIN AN OOOOH
She surrender to the feelin
SHE SWEETLY SURRENDERED
An she started in to squealin

DinahMoe watched from the edge of the bed
With her lips just atwitchin an her face gone red
Some drool rollin down
From the edge of her chin
While she spied the condition
Her sister was in
She quivered n quaked
An clutched at herself
While her sister made a joke
About her mental health
Till DinahMoe finally
Did give in
But I told her
All she really needed
Was some discipline

Kiss my aura    Dora
