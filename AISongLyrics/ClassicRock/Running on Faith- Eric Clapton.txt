Lately Ive been running on faith
What else can a poor boy do
But my world will be right
When love comes over you

Lately Ive been talking in my sleep
I cant imagine what Id have to say
Except my world will be right
When love comes back your way

Ive always been
One to take each and every day
Seems like by now
Id find a love who cares just for me

Then wed go running on faith
All of our dreams would come true
And our world will be right
When love comes over me and you

Ive always been
One to take each and every day
Seems like by now
Id find a love who cares just for me

Then wed go running on faith
All of our dreams would come true
And our world will be right
When love comes over me and you
When love comes over you
