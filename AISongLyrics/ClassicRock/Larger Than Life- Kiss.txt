If you want to make believe
Theres nothing up my sleeve
Im a man as man can be
As you can plainly see
Dont want to see no tears
Alleviate your fears
When you think youve seen it all baby
You cant believe your eyes what you heard werent lies
My love is too much to hold too much to hold
Much to large
Im someone you cant fight
Im man in size
You cant believe your eyes
What you heard were not lies
Im too much to hold
I cant be bought or sold
Im far more than a man
Im gonna make you understand
Im larger than a life size man
And you cant believe your eyes what you heard werent lies
My love is too much to hold too much to hold
My love is larger than life ooh larger than life
My love is larger than life larger than life
My love is too much to hold it cant be sold oh no
You cant believe your eyes what you heard werent lies
My love is too much to hold too much to hold
My love is larger than life larger than life
My love is larger than life larger than life
My love is too much to hold it cant be sold oh no
Im larger than a life size man
My love is larger than life larger than life
My love is larger than life ooh larger than life
My love is too much to hold it cant be sold oh no
