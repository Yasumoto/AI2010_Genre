Just take those old records off the shelf
Ill sit and listen to em by myself
Todays music aint got the same soul
I like that old time rock n roll
Dont try to take me to a disco
Youll never even get me out on the floor
In ten minutes Ill be late for the door
I like that old time rock n roll
Still like that old time rock n roll
That kind of music just soothes the soul
I reminisce about the days of old
With that old time rock n roll
Wont go to hear them play a tango
Id rather hear some blues or funky old soul
Theres only sure way to get me to go
Start playing old time rock n roll
Call me a relic call me what you will
Say Im oldfashioned say Im over the hill
Today music aint got the same soul
I like that old time rock n roll
Still like that old time rockn roll
That kind of music just soothes the soul
I reminisce about the days of old
With that old time rock n roll
Still like that old time rockn roll
That kind of music just soothes the soul
I reminisce about the days of old
With that old time rock n roll
Still like that old time rockn roll
That kind of music just soothes the soul
I reminisce about the days of old
With that old time rock n roll
Still like that old time rock n roll
That kind of music just soothes the soul
I reminisce about the days of old
With that old time rock n roll
