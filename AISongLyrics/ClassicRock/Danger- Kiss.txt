Heaven dont send me someone to love
Angels know theyre not what I am dreamin of
Tell me bout your fantasies
You know what I need tonight
Baby you and me
Were like TNT
Light the dynamite
Too much trouble
Double down tough
Danger you Danger Me
Danger Us
People dont always know what they need
Passion play can make a lonely heart bleed
I dont want my candy sweet
You dont want your lovin nice
Everytime we meet
Were like TNT
Light the dynamite
Too much trouble
Double down tough
Danger you Danger Me
Danger Us
Two parts trouble
Ready steady rough
Danger you Danger Me
Danger Us
Tell me bout your fantasies
You know what I need tonight
Baby you and me
Were like TNT
Light the dynamite
Two parts trouble
Double down tough
Danger you Danger Me
Danger Us
Two parts trouble
Ready steady rough
Danger you Danger Me
Danger Us
