Heaven on Earth we need it now
Im sick of all of this hanging around
Sick of sorrow sick of the pain
Im sick of hearing again and again
That theres gonna be peace on Earth

Where I grew up there werent many trees
Where there was wed tear them down
And use them on our enemies
They say that what you mock
Will surely overtake you
And you become a monster
So the monster will not break you

And its already gone too far
Who said that if you go in hard
You wont get hurt

Jesus can you take the time
To throw a drowning man a line
Peace on Earth
Tell the ones who hear no sound
Whose sons are living in the ground
Peace on Earth
No whos or whys
No one cries like a mother cries
For peace on Earth
She never got to say goodbye
To see the color in his eyes
Now hes in the dirt
Peace on Earth

Theyre reading names out over the radio
All the folks the rest of us wont get to know
Sean and Julia Gareth and Ann and Breda
Their lives are bigger than any big idea

Jesus can you take the time
To throw a drowning man a line
Peace on Earth
To tell the ones who hear no sound
Whose sons are living in the ground
Peace on Earth
Jesus sing a song you wrote
The words are sticking in my throat
Peace on Earth
Hear it every Christmas time
But hope and history wont rhyme
So whats it worth
This peace on Earth

Peace on Earth
Peace on Earth
Peace on Earth
