I know deep inside of me
theres a place but its not plain to see
I belong where no on else can be
Im searching for myself again
Here Im all alone and when
I Close my eyes  no one else can see
I Walk Alone cant you see
I dont belong let me be
Everything I dreamed of being  is me
And I got myself to lean on
I got both my feet on the ground
And you dont know me
I dont know me
I cant see you
you cant see me
close my eyes and leave the world behind
So I got no heart and I got no home
I got no somewhere I belong
I dont worry everythings just fine
I Walk Alone cant you see
I dont belong let me be
Everything that I dreamed of being
and I dont belong cant you see
I Walk Alone let me be
Everything that I dreamed of being  is me
And I got myself to lean on
I got both my feet on the ground
So I got no heart and I got no home
And I got no somewhere I belong
I dont worry everythings just
And I got myself to lean on
got both my feet on the ground
And I got myself to lean on
I got both my feet on the ground
Cause I know deep inside of me
Theres a place but its not plain to see
where I belong where no one else can be
And Im searching for myself again
And here Im all alone and when
I close my eyes and no one else can see
