I just cant understand the ways
Of all the men and their mistakes
You give them all your heart
And then they rip it all away
You told me how much you loved me
And how our love was meant to be
And I believed in you
I thought that you would set me free
You shouldve just told me the truth
That I wasnt the girl for you
Still I didnt have a clue
So my heart depended on you whoa
Although Ill say I hate you now
Though Ill shout and curse you out
Ill always have love for you
Because I am a girl
Been told a man will leave you cold
Get sick of you and bored
I know that its no lie
I gave my all still I just cry
Never again will I be fooled
To give my all when nothings true
I wont be played again
But I will fall in love again
Been told a man will leave you cold
Get sick of you and bored
I know that its no lie
I gave my all still I just cry
Never again will I be fooled
To give my all when nothings true
I wont be played again
But I will fall in love again
You took advantage of my willingness
To do anything for love
Now Im the only one in pain
Will you please take it all away
Never thought being born a girl
How I can love you and be burned
And now I will build a wall
To never get torn again
