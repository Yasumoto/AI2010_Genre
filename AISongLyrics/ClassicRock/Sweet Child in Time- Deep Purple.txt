Sweet child in time
Youll see the line
The line thats drawn between
The good and bad
See the blind man
Shooting at the world
Bullets flying
Oh taking toll
If youve been bad
Oh Lord I bet you have
And youve not been hit
Oh by flying lead
Youd better close your eyes
Oh bow your head
Wait for the ricochet
