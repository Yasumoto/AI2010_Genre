Its been a hard days night
And Ive been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right

You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And its worth it just to hear you say
Youre gonna give me everything

So why on earth should I moan
Cos when I get you alone
You know Ill feel okay

When Im home
Everything seems to be right
When Im home
Feeling you holding me tight oh
Tight yeah

Its been a hard days night
And Ive been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right
Ow

So why on earth should I moan
Cos when I get you alone
You know Ill feel okay

When Im home
Everything seems to be riight
When Im home
Feeling you holding me tight
Tight yeah

Ooh its been a hard days night
And Ive been working like a dog
Its been a hard days night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right
You know I feel all right
You know I feel all right
