she was a fast machine
she kept her motor clean
she was the best damn woman i had ever seen
she had the sightless eyes
telling me no lies
knockin me out with those american thighs
taking more than her share
had me fighting for air
she told me to cum but i was already there
cause the walls start shaking
the earth was quaking
my mind was aching
and we were making it and you
shook me all night long
yeah you shook me all night long
working double time
on the seduction line
she was one of a kind shes just mine all mine
she wanted no applause
just another course
made a meal out of me and came back for more
had to cool me down
to take another round
now im back in the ring
to take another swing
cause the walls were shaking
the earth was quaking
my mind was aching
and we were making it and you
shook me all night long
yeah you shook me all night long
and knocked me out and then you
shook me all night long
you had me shakin and you
shook me all night long
yeah you shook me
well you took me
you reall took me and you
shook me all night long
ooh you
shook me all night long
yeah yeah you
shook me all night long
your really took me and you
yeah you shook me yeah you shook me
all night long
