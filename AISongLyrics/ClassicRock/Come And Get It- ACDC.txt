Picking up the sleaze in my car
Hell no distance too far
Burning down the road in the night
Dont you scold me or Ill bite
These are the finer things in life
Dont think you live in paradise
Ive got my filly wrapped in red
Upon my double decker bed
If you want it come and get it come and get it
If you want it come and get it come and get it
If you want it come and get it come and get it
If you want it come and get it
Suckin up the juice in the bar
Downin every shooter so far
Checkin out the girls what a sight
If you gonna blow me do it right
These are the finer things in life
Dont think you live in paradise
Ive got my filly wrapped in red
Upon my double decker bed
If you want it come and get it come and get it
If you want it come and get it come and get it
If you want it come and get it come and get it
If you want it come and get it
Come and get it
Said if you want it come and get it
If you want it come and get it yeah
Now listen come and get it
If you want it come and get it come and get it
If you want it come and get it come and get it
I said if you want it come and get it
If you want it come and get it
If you want it
If you want it
If you want it come and get it
Come and get it right here
