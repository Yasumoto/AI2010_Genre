Hold your breath quiet now dont say a word
You could run but it wont do any good
Prayers forsaken when you lose faith inside
Its not time to die

Your life
Is it a lie
When you get what youre looking for
Your craves subside
Or will you crawl into
A casket
An early tomb
Lay down and give up inside
Shed rather die

When you fall
So spent from emotion
She is what
Brings you to your feet
Where challenges lie
On the verge of destruction
She pulls you back
And she gives you wings
Death wont hold you as tight as she will

Can you feel her
Running through your veins
She will always live forever
Can you bear the burden

Can you feel her
Running through your veins
She will always live forever
Can you bear the burden

Youll turn your back youll patronize
Shes pleading
You will question your every want
Shes bleeding out
Shes bleeding out
Shes bleeding out

Death wont hold you as tight as she will

Can you feel her blood run through your veins
She will always live forever
Can you bear the burden
Can you feel her burning through your veins
She will always live forever

Guitar Solo

Shes bleeding out
Shes bleeding out
Shes bleeding out

Heart beat gradually slows

Death wont hold you as tight as she will

Can you feel her running through your veins
She will always live forever
Can you bear the burden
Can you feel her running through your veins
She will always live forever
Can you bear the burden

Can you feel her running through your veins
She will always live forever
Can you bear the burden
Can you feel her running through your veins
She will always live forever
