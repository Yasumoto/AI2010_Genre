Say your prayers little one
dont forget my son
to include everyone
tuck you in warm within
keep you free from sin
till the sandman he comes
sleep with one eye open
gripping your pillow tight
exit light
enter night
take my hand
off to never never land
somethings wrong shut the light
heavy thoughts tonight
and they arent of snow white
dreams of war dreams of liars
dreams of dragons fire
and of things that will bite
sleep with one eye open
gripping your pillow tight
exit light
enter night
take my hand
off to never never land
now I lay me down to sleep
pray the lord my soul to keep
if I die before I wake
pray the lord my soul to take
hush little baby dont say a word
and never mind that noise you heard
its just the beast under your bed
in your closet in your head
exit light
enter night
grain of sand
exit light
enter night
take my hand
were off to never never land
