Ooh a storm is threatning
My very life today
If I dont get some shelter
Oh yeah Im gonna fade away

War children its just a shot away
Its just a shot away
War children its just a shot away
Its just a shot away

Ooh see the fire is sweepin
Our very street today
Burns like a red coal carpet
Mad bull lost its way

War children yes its just a shot away
Its just a shot away
War children its just a shot away
Its just a shot away

Rape murder its just a shot away
Its just a shot away
Rape murder yeah its just a shot away
Its just a shot away
Rape murder its just a shot away
Its just a shot away

Mmm the floods is threatning
My very life today
Gimme gimme shelter
Or Im gonna fade away

War children its just a shot away
Its just a shot away
Its just a shot away
Its just a shot away
Its just a shot away
I tell you love sister its just a kiss away
Its just a kiss away
Its just a kiss away
Its just a kiss away
Its just a kiss away
Kiss away kiss away
