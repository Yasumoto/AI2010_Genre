Aint it funny how the time slips away
Cause now Im leavin and I wish I could stay
People wonder why they dont get a chance
They wait for music but they dont get to dance
Mmm well now I know when my work is through
Im gonna be with you
So goodbye
Is only for now
Cause Im comin back
I swear it somehow
Aint it funny how we win but we lose
Were given prizes that we dont get to use
People wonder bout the things that weve got
It seems so little but we know its a lot
Now I know when my work is through
Im gonna be with you oh yeah
Im gonna be with you
So goodbye is only for now
Cause Im comin back I swear it somehow
Oh goodbye is only for now
Cause Im comin back I swear it somehow
Sing it
Im on the run
So I must go
And I hate to leave
I hope that you know
Oh goodbye is only for now
Cause Im comin back I swear it somehow
