Its all the same only the names will change
Everyday it seems were wasting away
Another place where the faces are so cold
Id drive all night just to get back home

Im a cowboy on a steel horse I ride
Im wanted dead or alive
Wanted dead or alive

Sometimes I sleep sometimes its not for days
And the people I meet always go their separate ways
Sometimes you tell the day
By the bottle that you drink
And times when youre alone all you do is think

Im a cowboy on a steel horse I ride
Im wanted dead or alive
Wanted dead or alive

I walk these streets a loaded six string on my back
I play for keeps cause I might not make it back
I been everywhere and Im standing tall
Ive seen a million faces an Ive rocked them all

Im a cowboy on a steel horse I ride
Im wanted dead or alive
Im a cowboy I got the night on my side
Im wanted dead or alive
And I ride dead or alive
I still drive dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
