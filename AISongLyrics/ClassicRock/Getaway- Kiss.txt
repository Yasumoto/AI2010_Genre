Ive been tryin to get away
To get away
To leave this old town
Ive been tryin to see my way
To see my way
So I wont be found
Many times Ive felt alone
Ive felt alone
But thats all behind
One thing I know
I know
One thing is that
I know I have to go
Got no dough
Should I stay or should I go
Gotta get away
Dont want to stay
Leavin tomorrow find someway
Some people they tell me
They tell me
Ive been here to long
It dont compel me
They tell me
I just dont belong
Sometimes I wonder
I wonder
Whats right or whats wrong
One thing I
I know
One thing is that
I know I have to go
Got no dough
Should I stay or should I go
Gotta get away
Dont want to stay
Leavin tomorrow find someway
I gotta get away
Get away get away get away
I gotta get away
Yeah baby get away gotta gotta gotta get away
Whoo youve gotta get away
