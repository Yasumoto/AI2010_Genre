A world without heroes
Is like a world without sun
You cant look up to anyone
Without heroes
And a world without heroes
Is like a never ending race
Is like a time without a place
A pointless thing devoid of grace
well you dont know what youre after
Or if somethings after you
And you dont know why you dont know
In a world without heroes
In a world without dreams
Things are no more than they seem
And a world without heroes
Is like a bird without wings
Or a bell that never rings
such a sad and useless thing
well you dont know what youre after
Or if somethings after you
well you dont know why you dont know
And a world without heroes
Is nothing to be
Its no place for me
