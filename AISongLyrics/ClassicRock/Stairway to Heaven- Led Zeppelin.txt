And shes buying a stairway to heavenWhen she gets there she knows if the stores are all closed With a word she can get what she came forOoh ooh and shes buying a stairway to heaven Theres a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure Cause you know sometimes words have two meaningsIn a tree by the brook theres a songbird who singsSometimes all of our thoughts are misgivenOoh it makes me wonderOoh it makes me wonder Theres a feeling I get when I look to the westAnd my spirit is crying for leaving In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the treesAnd the voices of those who standing lookingOoh it makes me wonderOoh it really makes me wonderAnd its whispered that soon if we all call the tune Then the piper will lead us to reasonAnd a new day will dawn for those who stand long And the forests will echo with laughterIf theres a bustle in your hedgerow dont be alarmed nowIts just a spring clean for the May queenYes there are two paths you can go by but in the long run Theres still time to change the road youre onAnd it makes me wonderYour head is humming and it wont go in case you dont knowThe pipers calling you to join himDear lady can you hear the wind blow and did you know Your stairway lies on the whispering wind And as we wind on down the road Our shadows taller than our soulThere walks a lady we all know Who shines white light and wants to show How everything still turns to goldAnd if you listen very hard The tune will come to you at last When all are one and one is all To be a rock and not to roll And shes buying a stairway to heaven
