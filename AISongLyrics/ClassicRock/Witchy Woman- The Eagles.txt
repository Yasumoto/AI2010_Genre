raven hair and ruby lips
sparks fly from her finger tips
echoed voices in the night
shes a restless spirit on an endless flight
woo hoo witchy woman
see how high she flies
woo hoo witchy woman
she got the moon in her eyes
she held me spellbound in the night
dancing shadows and firelight
crazy laughter in another room
and she drove herself to madness with a silver spoon
woo hoo witchy woman
see how high she flies
woo hoo witchy woman
she got the moon in her eyes
well i know you want to love her
let me tell you brother
shes been sleeping in the devils bed
and theres some rumors going round
someones underground
she can rock you in the nighttime
til your skin turns red
woo hoo witchy woman
see how high she flies
woo hoo witchy woman
she got the moon in her eyes
