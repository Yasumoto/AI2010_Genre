Just a small town girl living in alonly world
She took the midnight train going anywhere
Just a city boy born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train going anywhere

A singer in a smoky room the smell of wine and cheap parfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waiting up down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin in the night
Streetlight people living to find emotion
Hiding somewhere in the night

Working hard to get my fill everybody wants a thrill
Payin anything to roll the dice Just one more time
Some will win some will lose some were born to sing the blues
Oh the movie never ends It goes on and on and on and on

Dont stop believing
Hold on to the feeling
Streetlight people
