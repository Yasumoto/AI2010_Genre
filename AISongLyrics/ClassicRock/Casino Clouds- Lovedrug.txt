You left tuesday and by wednesday you were so alone
Is this your nightmare man
The millions of punch drunks and the cannibal king is taking control
Now that youre burning in space
You try to remember her face and the crown of your heart
Now youre fighting for the manacle girls and boys
Like a kettle of keys
One of which might unlock all of these

If these are the black gates of hell
Then Im sorry for the life Ive wasted so
I forgot to fall in love
I forgot to call on the keystone clan
I never got to be a man at all

Your crocodile tears
Your manikin angel cage of fire is killing him so
Now youre searching for life up in these cold casino clouds
With your panicking eyes I am not alone

Now these are the angry jaws of death
Now this is the calm while Father Grim is smiling so
I never got to fully say
I never got to really explain myself
I forgot got to sing

I got us here I saw the sign
Now breathe in the air and youll be fine

Now I will never fall in love
Now I will never really explain myself
But honey I will sing
