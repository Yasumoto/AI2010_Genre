Your cruel device
Your blood like ice
One look could kill
My pain your thrill

I want to love you but I better not touch Dont touch
I want to hold you but my senses tell me to stop
I want to kiss you but I want it too much Too much
I want to taste you but your lips are venomous poison
Youre poison running through my veins
Youre poison I dont want to break these chains

Your mouth so hot
Your web Im caught
Your skin so wet
Black lace on sweat

I hear you calling and its needles and pins And pins
I want to hurt you just to hear you screaming my name
Dont want to touch you but youre under my skin Deep in
I want to kiss you but your lips are venomous poison
Youre poison running through my veins
Youre poison I dont wanna break these chains
Poison

One look could kill
My pain your thrill
I want to love you but I better not touch Dont touch
I want to hold you but my senses tell me to stop
I want to kiss you but I want it too much Too much
I want to taste you but your lips are venomous poison
Youre poison running through my veins
Youre poison I dont wanna break these chains
Poison

I want to love you but I better not touch Dont touch
I want to hold you but my senses tell me to stop
I want to kiss you but I want it too much Too much
I want to taste you but your lips are venomous poison yeah

Poison oh no
Runnin deep inside my veins
Burnin deep inside my veins
