Maybe life has got you run down
I think its time girl that we slow down
So take a look its almost sundown

So why dont you lay right here
Let me just ease your mind
Im givin you all my time
And Im gonna keep on keep on lovin you

Strong and slow
The way that you want me to
Baby my whole life through
Im gonna keep on keep on lovin you

When that morning sun is dawning
Baby both of us should call in
We got too much love to fall in

So why dont you lay right here
Let me just ease your mind
Im givin you all my time
And Im gonna keep on keep on lovin you

Strong and slow
The way that you want me to
Baby my whole life through
Im gonna keep on keep on lovin you


So why dont you lay right here
Let me just ease your mind
Im givin you all my time
And Im gonna keep on keep on

Strong and slow
The way that you want me to
Baby my whole life through
Im gonna keep on keep on lovin you

Strong and slow
The way that you want me to
Baby my whole life through
Im gonna keep on keep on keep on lovin you

Im gonna keep on keep on lovin you
